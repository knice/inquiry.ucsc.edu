<h3>Tenacious and toxic</h3>

<p>In 2015, normal spring upwelling combined with the arrival of the "blob"&mdash;an anomalous, excessively warm clump of Pacific water&mdash;created the biggest, longest-lasting, most toxic algal bloom ever seen along the West Coast.</p>

<p>Instead of dissipating after a few weeks, the bloom continued from May into October. Although individual cells only live a few days, the dead cells still contain domoic acid and accumulate in the bottom sediment, creating a reservoir of toxin that lasts for months.</p>

<p>Long after the bloom ended, Raphael Kudela's lab found domoic acid in mussels. For the first time, the toxin also turned up in the muscle tissue of several kinds of fish. While those fish were still safe to eat, it was a sign of how extensively the toxin contamination spread during the 2015 bloom.</p>

<p>"There was so much toxin that we found it dissolved in the water, not just in the bodies of animals," Kudela said.</p>
