Welcome to 7<sup>th</sup> annual edition of *inquiry@UC Santa Cruz*! stories featuring the broad range of research being performed across the university's five academic divisions. As in previous issues, the magazine's content was crafted by alumni of our world-renowned [Science Communication master\'s program](https://scicom.ucsc.edu/) (see [INQUIRING**minds**](/2021-22/contributors/)).

Their writing this year invites you to: contemplate an America with true liberty and justice for all, delivered without imprisonment; travel with researchers on ocean voyages to collect and analyze tiny fossils for clues about the coming impacts of climate change; peer over the shoulders of internet sleuths leveraging open-access data in the global fight for human rights; relish the drama of marshlands where coots sneak their unhatched offspring into each other's nests; consider how ancient ruins reflect people's intentional efforts, rather than simply things left behind; and applaud Nobel prize--winning research on telomeres---a potential key to understanding aging.

In addition, select your next great read from the latest books authored by our faculty (see [PEN**&**INQ](/2021-22/books/)) and peruse recently patented faculty inventions, described in [**inquiries&**INNOVATIONS](/2021-22/innovations/). All this and more awaits in the pages that follow.

This year we celebrate in particular the unflinching dedication of the campus\'s research community, whose members---as revealed in our cover story, "Adaptable academics"---found ways to persevere in their mission to seek answers to difficult questions despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic. We invite you to join us as we recognize their hard-fought achievements and look forward to a less trying future.
