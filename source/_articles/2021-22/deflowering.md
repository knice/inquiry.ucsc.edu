Flowers as symbols are loaded with meaning. So, what does a flower mean
when seen through the lens of [Robert
Mapplethorpe](http://www.mapplethorpe.org/biography/), the controversial
photographer best known for his depictions of radical
sexuality?

Mapplethorpe became famous for his celebrity party pictures in the
magazine [*Interview*](https://www.interviewmagazine.com/) and his
explicit photography of queer subcultures. But leading up to his death
from AIDS in 1989, he focused on portraits of flowers. For [**Derek
Conrad Murray**](https://havc.ucsc.edu/faculty/derek-murray),
professor of history of art and visual culture, Mapplethorpe's prolific
flower artwork---more than 500 published works---trumpets the same
themes as his earlier, more highly regarded work, noted for its coupling
of classical beauty and risqué nature.

Mapplethorpe is one of few artists who could make flowers look beautiful
but also subversive and dangerous, Murray said. ["There\'s something
provocative about them. They can make you uncomfortable.
W](https://havc.ucsc.edu/faculty/derek-murray)[hen you look at the
various meanings associated with flowers, and then at Mapplethorpe's
BDSM images, or images of Black
men,](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/mapplethorpe-and-the-flower-9781788312516/)
some of the deeper meanings are the same."
