<figcaption markdown="span">Above: Conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas used a photograph of prisoners grasping a Nazi concentration camp barbed wire fence to create his bronze sculpture, [*If the Leader Only Knew*, 2014](https://barringfreedom.org/artists/hank-willis-thomas/), included in the [*Barring Freedom*](https://barringfreedom.org/) exhibition. Part of a series, the piece casts "the current state apparatuses of prisons, jails, and detention within a wider history of racism and dehumanization." Credit: ©Hank Willis Thomas, courtesy of Hank Willis Thomas and the Jack Shainman Gallery, New York.</figcaption>
