## Gardening from death row ##

Tim Young makes quite intentional choices for his garden on the UCSC campus, 90 miles from his solitary prison cell in San Quentin State Prison. Each plant has special meaning, explained in letters to his proxy gardeners. About the daisies fronting the door of the garden\'s prison cell sculpture, he wrote: "Prison cells are often referred to as 'coffins' or 'concrete tombs.' When people enter the cell, they should know it was specifically designed to punish, oppress, and bring about one\'s demise. Hence, 'pushing up daisies.'"

The [*Solitary Garden*](https://barringfreedom.org/exhibitions/solitary-garden.html), part of the *Barring Freedom* project, invites visitors to contemplate Young\'s severely confined world. Perched on a hillside overlooking Monterey Bay, the sculpture replicates the size of the 6-by-9-foot cell where Young has spent nearly every hour of every day for 15 years following his homicide conviction and death sentence. He proclaims his innocence and has been actively appealing his case, vicariously treasuring in the meantime the garden he envisioned that borders the sculpture.

Most U.S. prisons have places where incarcerated men and women like Young are kept in extreme isolation, sometimes for decades. According to the best estimates of the nonprofit [Solitary Watch](https://solitarywatch.org/facts/faq/), at least 80,000 prisoners exist under this condition on any given day. Isolation makes people depressed and puts them at greater risk for physical illness and dying young, said UCSC psychologist **Craig Haney**, a leading expert on the effects of solitary confinement and ardent advocate for its elimination.

The publicly created *Solitary Garden, UCSC* is one of 17 such gardens around the country orchestrated by artist [jackie sumell](https://barringfreedom.org/artists/jackie-sumell/). Her [artwork](https://solitarygardens.org/) intentionally involves the community in "planting" hope for prison abolition and the end of solitary confinement. "A *Solitary Garden* is a collaborative social practice that 'seeds' important conversations around alternatives to incarceration," she said. "It asks us to imagine a landscape without prisons."

[**Jocelyn Lopez-Anleu**](https://arts.ucsc.edu/features/featured-story/ucsc-havc-alumna-focuses-including-underrepresented-communities-arts), a '20 graduate now working as a curatorial assistant at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, tended *Solitary Garden* as an undergraduate intern with other students and volunteers. Right before the pandemic closed everything down, she and project co-curator Rachel Nelson met Young at San Quentin, an experience Lopez-Anleu described as "one of her most powerful" while working on *Barring Freedom*. For visitors to *Solitary Garden*, "The horrific truth that a person presently exists in those confines becomes apparent," said Lopez-Anleu. "But just next to it are all these plants and flowers that act as an extension of that person's body, mind, and soul."
