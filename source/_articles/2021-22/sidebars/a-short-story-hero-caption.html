<figcaption markdown="span">Above: Telomeres (pink dots) at the end of chromosomes help protect genetic material from being degraded when cells divide and multiply. The research of Carol Greider, distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, has illuminated the cellular mechanisms that keep these caps from becoming too short and promises to provide insights about the biology of age-related diseases and cancer.
