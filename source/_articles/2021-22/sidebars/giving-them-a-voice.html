## Giving them a voice ##

The state of emergency at the pandemic's start prompted Professor Sharon Daniel to create [*EXPOSED*](https://www.unjustlyexposed.com/). Daniel, a digital media artist with a long history of activism around prison abolition, knew the outbreak would hit incarcerated people hard. She felt a pressing urgency to give them a voice, she said, a way for the public to hear the growing alarm within prison walls.

So, Daniel set aside a long-term project in Alaska and switched to a new one. With no time to apply for grants, she paid a research assistant out-of-pocket, harnessed a team of undergraduate research interns, and had designer/programmer [Erik Loyer](https://erikloyer.com/), a frequent collaborator, modify a web program created for the Alaska project. The hastily assembled team combed through hundreds of text and audio sources as the pandemic unfolded, documenting the pandemic's impact on the imprisoned in an [interactive timeline](https://www.unjustlyexposed.com/) of words, statistics, and sounds.

The catastrophe Daniel had predicted then exploded. The tight quarters, lack of personal protective equipment, and limited resources for health care provided "perfect conditions for superspreading events," said [Thomas Inglesby](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3492/thomas-v-inglesby), M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in a National Public Radio [interview](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/24/948873835/correctional-facilities-are-covid-19-hot-spots-why-dont-they-get-vaccine-priorit). According to [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons), as of early April 2021, more than 392,500 COVID-19 cases had been reported in prisoners, resulting in at least 2,515 deaths.

*EXPOSED* joins two other Daniel installation pieces, [*Undoing Time\|Pledge*](https://barringfreedom.org/artists/sharon-daniel/) and [*Amends\|Excessive Force*](https://barringfreedom.org/artists/sharon-daniel/), in *Barring Freedom*, with contingency grants from UCSC's [Arts Research Institute](https://arts.ucsc.edu/ari) and [Institute of the Arts and Sciences](https://ias.ucsc.edu/) funding the designer/programmer as well as the hands-free, autoplay version of *EXPOSED* launched online to coincide with the opening of the SJMA exhibition. Daniel hopes to find funding to support her team's ongoing updates of *EXPOSED*. "People inside are trying to take care of each other," she said, "even while the state strips them of any agency or ability to protect themselves, virtually abandoning them to let the virus run its course."
