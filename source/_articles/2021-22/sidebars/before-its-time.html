<h3 markdown="span">Before its time</h3>

<p markdown="span">For a moment in late 1950s England, the [Fairey Rotodyne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkJOm1V77Xg) promised airborne intercity mobility even more ambitious than that now envisioned by today's developers of electric air taxis. An all-in-one helicopter, airplane, and [gyrocopter](http://flyargo.aero/en/why-gyrocopters/) (a helicopter-like aircraft with an unmotorized, autorotating rotor), the Rotodyne took off and landed vertically like a helicopter by virtue of jets on the tips of its rotors. In horizontal flight, the rotors auto-rotated like a gyrocopter, turned by just the horizontal air flow, providing half the lift for the aircraft while it cruised like an airplane, powered by the two engines on its wings. To land, the pilot fired up the rotor tip jets again.</p>

<p>A full-scale prototype flew 350 successful test flights, establishing its safety. Capable of carrying 18,000 lbs, the Rotodyne was expected to ferry 40 passengers at a speed of 372 km/h over a range of 700 km.</p>

<p markdown="span">The fish-nor-fowl craft had two serious problems, however, one technical, the other financial and fatal. The rotor tip jets screamed ambulance-siren-loud at 113 db. Engineers reduced that to 96 db with "silencers," but then the money ran out. Having funded much of the project's decade-long development, the British government in 1962 balked at the additional Â£10 million (\~\$14 million) needed to proceed to full production, sweeping the Rotodyne into the dustbin of history.</p>
