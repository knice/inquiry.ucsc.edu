<h3 markdown="span">Deep roots</h3>

<p markdown="span">The fact that the pandemic has disproportionally impacted people of color and low-income families is no surprise for those who have been keeping up with American history. As former president Barack Obama said during his 2020 [virtual commencement speech](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/05/16/obama-tells-2020-graduates-if-worlds-going-get-better-it-going-be-up-you-read-transcripts-two-speeches/) to graduates of historically Black colleges and universities, "Injustice like this isn't new. What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing." Now, laid bare by the pandemic, the extent of this injustice has become harder to disregard.</p>

<p markdown="span">Before COVID-19 hit, the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s/) found that the income gap between white and Black Americans grew, as measured in 2018 dollars, from about $23,800 in 1970 to $33,000 in 2018. Middle-class incomes have also increased at a slower rate than upper-class ones over the past five decades, putting more than half of all Americans at a clear disadvantage.</p>

<p markdown="span">Income inequality translates to big differences in early childhood education, according to [research from the Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/publication/education-inequalities-at-the-school-starting-gate/), a Washington, DC, non-partisan, nonprofit think tank that studies the impact of economic trends and policy on working people. Their work shows persistently large achievement gaps, including test scores, high school graduation rates, and college attendance, between children of high- versus low-socioeconomic class across the U.S. Strategies to address kids' needs before kindergarten, such as prenatal and pre-K programs, have been shown to shrink these gaps, yet they remain poorly funded. "The U.S. government invests less in children under the age of five than do most other developed nations," write Morrissey and her three coauthors in their 2021 book, [Cradle to Kindergarten: A New Plan to Combat Inequality](https://www.russellsage.org/publications/cradle-kindergarten-2ndEdition) (Russell Sage Foundation). "Child care and preschool in the U.S. are scarce, prohibitively expensive, and inadequate in quality for most middle- and low-income families."</p>

<p markdown="span">Yet families still depend on child care in order to work full-time jobs. And COVID-19 has caused mass closures of these centers, many of which may [not reopen after the pandemic ends](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/02/16/day-care-preschool-permanently-closed-covid/6734968002/). "So many child care programs that operate on razor thin margins in good times are struggling or can't make it work now," said Morrissey. This will further exacerbate the educational divide that Azmitia and others study. "Programs that support families, including child care, help kids and families reach their educational goals," said Azmitia.</p>

Yet the U.S. invests less in children under the age of five than most other developed nations. As centers closed during the pandemic, access to child care decreased, exacerbating the problem.
