<h3 id="rational-vaccine-design">Rational vaccine design</h3>
<p>The traditional way of developing vaccines is to alter a virus (or other infectious agent) so that it cannot cause disease but can still prompt the human immune system to arm itself against the real thing. This can be done by either killing the virus, or by “attenuating” it, meaning chemically or genetically altering it without killing it. The choice of method depends on the disease.</p>
<p>Structure-based approaches, like those used in the lab of UCSC virologist Rebecca DuBois, seek to build vaccines piece-by-piece instead of starting with the whole virus. To do this, scientists need to know more about the molecular structures on the surface of the virus, especially how they trigger infection, disease, and the immune response. This strategy has great potential to help improve on existing vaccines and engineer new ones that will work against diseases that have so far eluded the traditional development approach.</p>
