<figcaption>Above left: Structure of a human antibody (light and dark blue) bound to the RSV G protein (yellow). RSV uses the G protein to attach itself to cells in the human respiratory tract and to modify the human immune response to virus infection. DuBois and colleagues have discovered how protective human antibodies stick to the G protein and are engineering the protein for use in a vaccine. Above right, inset photographs: Protein crystals of antibody bound to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) G protein are used in x-ray crystallography studies in the laboratory of UCSC assistant professor of biomolecular engineering Rebecca DuBois. The single crystal on the right is about 0.3 millimeters across, just barely visible to the naked eye. Credit, all images this feature: Courtesy of Rebecca DuBois.</figcaption>
