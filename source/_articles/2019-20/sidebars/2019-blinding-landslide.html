<h3>A blinding landslide of multiple avalanches</h3>

<p>
    Even though terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGF) develop deep inside the Earth’s atmosphere and then lose a lot of intensity moving out into space, they are still bright enough to saturate the detectors on satellites orbiting 400 miles above our planet. By the early 2000s, it was clear that an avalanche of electrons accelerated to near relativistic speeds by the powerful electric fields inside thunderclouds could create gamma rays (see main story). Yet, just one avalanche wasn’t enough to account for the brightness of TGFs. In 2003, <a href="https://ceps.unh.edu/person/joseph-richard-dwyer">Joseph Dwyer</a>, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of New Hampshire, suggested that an avalanche of electrons can initiate other avalanches—and this can explain the observed intensity of TGFs.
</p>

<p>Dwyer has proposed several possible ways avalanches might trigger new avalanches. In one, an avalanche of accelerating electrons smashes into the nuclei of atoms in the air and creates gamma rays. Some of these gamma rays scatter in the atmosphere and end up in the region where the initial avalanche started. There, the gamma rays kick off more electrons from atoms in the air, starting a new avalanche.</p>

<p>Another possibility involves the production of pairs of particles and their anti-particles. Collisions of gamma rays with atomic nuclei can result in the formation of electron and positron (anti-electron) pairs. Being positively charged, the positrons get drawn to the region where the electron avalanche began, kicking out more electrons from atoms in the air, similarly starting a new avalanche.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://physics.ucsc.edu/people/faculty/smithd.html">David Smith</a>, Dwyer’s colleague and professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, one of these processes or both could be active in thunderstorms. The theoretical calculations predict that TGFs will take up to 100 microseconds to reach full brightness, a result that is consistent with the observed data from actual TGFs.</p>
