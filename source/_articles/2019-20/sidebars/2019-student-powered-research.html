<h3>Student-powered research</h3>
<p>When community partners approached UCSC faculty about investigating the housing affordability crisis in Santa Cruz County, the challenge appeared daunting. To collect residents’ stories about their experiences would require a lot of feet on the ground and bilingual skills, said sociology associate professor <a href="https://sociology.ucsc.edu/about/directory-faculty.php?uid=smckay"><strong>Steve McKay</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In an approach admittedly “pretty unusual,” the faculty turned to students in their classes to make <a href="https://noplacelikehome.ucsc.edu/en/">No Place Like Home</a> (NPLH) possible. Since the project launched in 2015, about 250 students—mostly undergraduates—trained in data collection, participated in project discussions, created digital media, surveyed renters, analyzed data, conducted historical research, and helped plan and attended community meetings and presentations. They completed 150-question surveys with 1,900 residents.</p>
<p>Many of the students admitted to housing challenges themselves. It’s these personal experiences that helped them better connect with people to get stories that added richness to the data, said McKay. He and UCSC colleagues <a href="https://sociology.ucsc.edu/about/directory-faculty.php?uid=miriam"><strong>Miriam Greenberg</strong></a>, professor of sociology, and <a href="https://sociology.ucsc.edu/about/directory-faculty.php?uid=rlondon"><strong>Rebecca London</strong></a>, assistant professor of sociology, have since submitted a paper for publication about their model for engaging students in community-initiated research.</p>
<p>Fourth-year transfer student <strong>Jeff Hao</strong>, for instance, emigrated from China with his family and recalled growing up with the stress of rent hikes in the San Francisco Bay Area. Now, he and a roommate live in a converted garage in a house shared by eight people. “Working on NPLH helped me understand the reality my parents had always faced,” said the undergraduate major in sociology and education. Couch surfer <strong>Hermes Padilla</strong>, who hopes to graduate this year with a double major in community studies along with Latin American and Latino studies, was among the many students who used their bilingual skills to talk with residents who didn’t speak English. This proved especially valuable in the nearby agricultural community of Watsonville, with its large Latinx community. Residents Padilla surveyed often were proud and encouraging of him, he said, and they would thank him for doing the work and being a student.</p>
<p>These community connections weren’t a fluke. More than half the students who took the university field survey course were first-generation college students, eligible for <a href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/">Educational Opportunity Programs</a> (EOP), and from the Latinx community. Working for the project, many told the researchers, helped give them a better sense of place in Santa Cruz. NPLH, said one UCSC student in a post-study reflection, “helped me feel more connected to Santa Cruz. I only get to see the wealthy areas and it can be discouraging as a person of color. Interacting with more working-class people of color helped me feel like I wasn't alone.”</p>
<p>His involvement, said Hao, “was one of the most formative experiences of my college career. I really appreciated how they included us in all aspects of the project and valued our input.” In addition to learning important skills, the students made it possible for the university to meet both its research and public-service missions. Without students such as Hao and Padilla, the project wouldn’t have been the same, said McKay. “They lit it up.”</p>
