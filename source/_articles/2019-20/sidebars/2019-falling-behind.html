<p>Oklahoma high-school science teacher Craig Troxell told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/31/us/oklahoma-teachers-profiles/index.html">CNN</a> last year that his job as an educator didn’t pay enough to make ends meet. To meet the bills, he also drove a school bus, sold roofing, and mowed lawns. It got to be too much. Together with thousands of fed-up and worn-out <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/04/25/602859780/teacher-walkouts-a-state-by-state-guide">colleagues and supporters around the country</a>, Troxell walked out in protest. "We're at the end of the rope," he said.</p>
<p>Teachers aren’t the only ones. Across the country people complain about depleted wallets and bank accounts. In January 2019, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com">Bankrate</a> announced in its <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-0118/">Financial Security Index survey</a> that 58 percent of Americans reported that they couldn’t cover a financial emergency costing $1,000 out of their savings.</p>
<p>All this despite an economy that is booming. Close observers of U.S. households’ financial turmoil aren’t surprised. Wages have <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/">stagnated for decades</a>, and the 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government in 2018–19 highlighted just how precarious finances are for many U.S. families. Now is the time, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-pacitti/its-time-to-make-the-mini_b_9021136.html">some argue</a>, that the country should consider implementing living wages. “A living wage,” claim volunteers with North Carolina’s <a href="https://www.orangecountylivingwage.org/about">Orange County Living Wage</a> coalition, “can pull working families out of poverty.”</p>
<p>The minimum wage was <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/minimum_wage">initiated in the U.S. in 1938</a> in part to support a basic standard of living. But like real wages, the minimum has also stagnated. While the <a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu/">MIT Living Wage Calculator</a> pegs the 2018 living wage for a U.S. family of four at <a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu/articles/37-new-data-up-calculation-of-the-living-wage">$16.14 per hour</a>, the federal government mandates a minimum wage of just $7.25 per hour, a figure that 29 states have decided to <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx">raise</a> and continue doing so. California’s current $12-per-hour minimum wage is set to increase in phases to $15 per hour by 2022.</p>

<figcaption>A poster from the AFL-CIO alliance of labor unions in the 1950s-1960s declares the value of living wages. Currently, under the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>, the federal minimum wage is <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/q-a.htm">$7.25 per hour</a>. While many states have their own minimum wage laws with higher pay, <a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu/articles/31-bare-facts-about-the-living-wage-in-america-2017-2018">none</a> still meet the goal of a <a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu/">living wage</a>, which requires enough pay to cover basic necessities for a decent life.
