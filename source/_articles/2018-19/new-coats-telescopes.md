Silver makes better telescope mirrors. It reflects more visible and infrared light than aluminum, the metal most telescope mirrors are made from. But while aluminum forms a natural protective layer when exposed to air, silver doesn’t—that’s why it tarnishes.

To combat this degradation, telescope makers coat the silver with a protective layer using [physical vapor deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_vapor_deposition), spraying, for instance, aluminum oxide vapor onto the silver. Even so, the mirrors still corrode after a couple years.

The problem is that this coating method leaves pinhole-like gaps. “All kinds of stuff—oxygen, water, sulfur—those elements go through the pinholes to reach the silver,” said [**Nobby Kobayashi**](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/nobby), professor of electrical engineering.

With collaborators UC Observatories astronomers [**Andrew Phillips**](http://www.ucolick.org/~phillips/) and [**Michael Bolte**](http://www.ucolick.org/~bolte/home.html), UCSC postdoc [**David Fryauf**](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/dfryauf), and [Structured Materials Industries](https://www.smicvd.com/) (SMI), Kobayashi designed a new instrument that employs [atomic layer deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_layer_deposition) (ALD) to coat the silver. Widely used in making semiconductor chips, ALD creates a dense, even film by coating surfaces one atomic layer at a time.

Because ALD systems are designed for small, thin silicon wafers, the researchers had to build a much larger one to accommodate telescope mirrors. While the prototype is still being [tested](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Astronomical-Telescopes-Instruments-and-Systems/volume-3/issue-3/034001/Effect-of-intermediate-layers-on-atomic-layer-deposition-aluminum-oxide/10.1117/1.JATIS.3.3.034001.short), proof-of-principle [experiments](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/9924/99240S/Corrosion-protection-of-silver-based-telescope-mirrors-using-evaporated-anti/10.1117/12.2238749.short) have shown promising results, Kobayashi said.
