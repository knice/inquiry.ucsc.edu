<h3>A killer with history</h3>

<p>Anywhere from a few hours to a few days after being exposed to cholera, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholera/symptoms-causes/syc-20355287">the vomiting and uncontrollable, watery diarrhea starts</a>. As your body loses water, your muscles cramp, and your eyes and mouth feel as dry as cotton. When people die of this disease—sometimes within mere hours after symptoms appear—it’s because of dehydration. When they survive, it’s because they stayed hydrated through this seemingly endless diarrhea and vomiting.</p>

<p>In the 16th century, people living in the Ganges River delta—near the border of modern-day India and Bangladesh—called cholera “moryxy” and one historian wrote of how it killed so many that <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/history-of-cholera">communities struggled to bury all their dead</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/pandemic1817-23.html">In 1817</a>, contaminated rice from the Ganges delta began cholera’s spread around the globe. Within six years it had killed hundreds of thousands of people in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, Japan, the Persian Gulf, Turkey, and Syria.</p>

<p>In 1829, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/history-of-cholera">another cholera pandemic</a> emerged, again following trade and military routes from India—this time heading to Russia, where it killed hundreds of thousands, then spreading throughout Europe, thanks to Russian soldiers, and finally reaching North America by the 1840s, where it claimed the life of former U.S. president <a href="http://www.jameskpolk.com/james-polk-biography.php">James Polk</a>, as well as hundreds of thousands of others.</p>

<p>Throughout the 19th century, cholera epidemics and pandemics continued around the globe, spreading with the global movements of immigrants and travelers. During a large 1854 outbreak in London, physician John Snow discovered that a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/cholera-john-snow-and-the-grand-experiment-33494689/">contaminated pump</a> was responsible for spreading the disease—a finding credited with making Snow the father of modern epidemiology and eventually leading to hygienic changes in the water and waste systems of major cities.</p>

<p>In recent years, <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/cholera/en/">the vast majority of cholera cases have occurred in Africa</a>, with occasional small outbreaks in Iraq and India. In 2010, after a massive earthquake weakened Haiti’s already poor public health and sanitation infrastructure, cholera began to spread throughout the country. Hurricanes and slow rebuilding efforts led to a ripe ground for further spread over the coming years, and, as of 2017, over 800,000 Haitians were sickened, and nearly ten thousand died of the infection.</p>

<p>In Yemen, a cholera epidemic that began in 2016—tied to the ongoing war and collapsing infrastructure—<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/12/21/one-million-people-have-caught-cholera-in-yemen-you-should-be-outraged/?utm_term=.fa877b0bf796">has sickened more than a million people and killed thousands</a>. Based on the suspected number of cases, it’s considered the worst cholera epidemic in history and is not currently under control.</p>
