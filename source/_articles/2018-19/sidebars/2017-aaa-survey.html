<p>A 2017 American Automobile Association survey found that 78 percent of respondents were afraid to ride in an autonomous vehicle, and only 19 percent would trust the car to drive itself. It probably didn&#39;t help that an Uber self-driving car ran a red light on the first day of its short-lived pilot program last year in San Francisco. In addition, many people are uncomfortable with taking their eyes off the road even if they&#39;re not driving. In a 2017 poll by Morning Consult, a Washington, D.C.â€“based media and polling company, 55 percent of respondents said no emailing, 61 percent said no reading, and 75 percent said no sleeping in self-driving cars.</p>
