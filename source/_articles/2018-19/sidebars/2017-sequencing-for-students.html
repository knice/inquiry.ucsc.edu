<h2>Sequencing for students</h2>

<p>The portability and affordability of nanopore sequencing enables classrooms around the world to access genetic information before class ends. Students at the University of Cambridge, UK, extracted DNA from a smoothie and sequenced it using a MinION to identify its fruit ingredients. For this experiment, the group read ten million DNA bases, which, more than a decade ago, would have cost $100,000 using machines in a dedicated sequencing center, said Kerstin GÃ¶pfrich, a graduate student at the university, who donated her strawberry-banana smoothie to science.</p>
