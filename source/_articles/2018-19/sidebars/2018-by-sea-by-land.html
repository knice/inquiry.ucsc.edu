<h3>By sea and by land</h3>

<p>The first iteration of the <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Intra-American Slave Trade Database</span> consists almost exclusively of maritime voyages. In part that’s because most colonial settlements were on coasts and waterways, and ships were the most efficient means of transport. Many ships’ cargoes were also carefully logged, helping historians construct a detailed picture of seaborne trafficking.</p>

<p>Overland transport of slaves tended to involve spottier record keeping, making such movements harder to track. One major exception was in Brazil, where large convoys of captives were marched to mines deep in the country’s interior and official records were preserved. That’s enabled <a href="https://history.rice.edu/faculty/daniel-domingues">Daniel Domingues</a>, assistant professor of African History at Rice University, to collect data on thousands of overland journeys, which will be added to the *Intra-American Slave Trade Database* by 2019*,* pushing the total number of records to more than 15,000. Efforts by other researchers are also underway to document overland slave trafficking in North America, further expanding the database.</p>
