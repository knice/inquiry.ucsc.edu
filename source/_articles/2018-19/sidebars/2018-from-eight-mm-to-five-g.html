<h3>From 8mm to 5G to ?</h3>

<p>We’ve come a long way since 1893 when the first film production studio in the world, Thomas Edison’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison%27s_Black_Maria"><span style="font-style:italic">Black Maria</span></a> in West Orange, New Jersey, began shooting magic shows and vaudeville performances, lit via a retractable roof. Today, most of us have high-definition video cameras in our pockets, smartphones that give us the ability to chronicle every last second of our lives.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/entertainment/tech-generations/?utm_term=.01d1ebd9d6cb">rapid evolution</a> of technology has led to substantial changes in the way we relate to video. We make movies whenever we want with the virtual push of a button, capturing realities that used to be subject to “he said, she said” and trumpeting our accomplishments and adventures to the entire world in real-time. Kids growing up today live with technology that wasn’t even imagined in Star Trek. No one bothers to think of how amazing it is to so easily record baby’s first steps or school plays, to capture lip-synching in the car or suspected police brutality. Software automatically stabilizes images and enhances them to illuminate and define details. Artificial intelligence now powers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/technology/future-cameras-ai-brains.html">wearable cameras</a> that capture “interesting” moments throughout the day, all without a person ever having to touch record.</p>

<p>On top of it all, we can almost instantaneously watch a virtually limitless smorgasbord of video. By 2021, video is <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/complete-white-paper-c11-481360.html">projected</a> to account for more than 80% of all consumer Internet traffic; every second, a million minutes of video will cross the network. This video tsunami begs the question: What will future archivists, the Rick Prelingers of 50 years from now, be looking at, preserving, and researching?</p>
