<h2>Extraterrestrial nanopores</h2>

<p>Nanopores could be part of unmanned space expeditions one day. David Deamer, who first invented nanopore sequencing thirty years ago, and <b>Holger Schmidt,</b> an engineer at UC Santa Cruz, are working on a device that will look for signs of microbial life around Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. As the Cassini spacecraft flew past the moon, it detected ice and organic compounds in an atmospheric plume of water. Those ingredients indicated a hydrothermal vent spewed salty ocean water into the moon&#39;s atmosphere, conditions that astrobiologists consider could host microbial life.</p>

<p>To detect viruses using a nanopore, Deamer wants to use solid-state pores developed by Daniel Branton, biology professor emeritus at Harvard University, and one of the co-inventors on the first nanopore sequencing patent. As Deamer continued experimenting with protein pores, Branton switched to studying nanopores carved into thin sheets of silicon nitride. These solid-state pores have not yet been used for sequencing because it&#39;s hard to control the pore dimension with enough precision to give reproducible signals, Branton said. Also, the tiny signals from DNA passing through solid-state pores are harder to detect compared to those from protein pores.</p>

<p>But solid-state pores can withstand larger temperature and pressure variations than protein pores, making them ideal for the harsh conditions of outer space. Deamer and Schmidt plan to build a device with a solid-state nanopore large enough to allow viruses through. Viruses passing through the pore would trigger additional laser-based analyses of the salts, minerals, and organic compounds on the outside of the virus, providing researchers more information about its surroundings. &quot;I think nanopores may have new life in solid-state systems for detecting life,&quot; Deamer said.</p>
