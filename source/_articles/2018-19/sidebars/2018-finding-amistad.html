<h3>Finding the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span></h3>

<p>Tens of thousands of visitors explore the <span style="font-style:italic;">Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database</span> (TSTD) at <a href="http://www.slavevoyages.org/"><span style="font-style:italic;">slavevoyages.org</span></a> each year. Many of them search for one ship in particular: the schooner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Amistad"><span style="font-style:italic">Amistad</span></a>, depicted on the cover and famed for a slave revolt in 1839 and a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118607/">Steven Spielberg blockbuster</a> more than 150 years later.</p>

<p>But those queries come up empty. The TSTD lists only transoceanic voyages, whereas the <span style="font-style:italic">Amistad</span> was engaged in more local business. When its African captives rebelled, they were being transported from one end of Cuba to the other. That’s one of many gaps the <span style="font-style:italic">Intra-American Slave Trade Database</span> will fill. When it’s published on the <span style="font-style:italic">slavevoyages.org</span> site this year, the new database will provide searchable records of thousands of slave-carrying ships that sailed American waters—including the <span style="font-style:italic">Amistad</span>.</p>
