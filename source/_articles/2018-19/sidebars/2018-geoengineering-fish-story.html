<h3>A geoengineering fish story</h3>

<p>Greater international governance of geoengineering may help rein in rogue experiments, such as the ocean fertilization scheme attempted by the <a href="http://www.haidasalmonrestoration.com/">Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation</a> in 2012. The group dumped about 120 tons of iron dust into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of British Columbia in the hope that adding this nutrient to iron-deficient waters would trigger a phytoplankton bloom that would revive the local salmon population. To undertake the project, American entrepreneur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_George">Russ George</a> partnered with the <a href="http://discoveringourstory.wisdomoftheelders.org/history-of-the-haida-tribe">Haida tribe</a>, a First Nations society on Canada’s Queen Charlotte Islands that historically has depended on salmon for its livelihood. The tribe invested \$2.5 million dollars in the corporation, which in turn, had planned to sell carbon offset credits on the international market for the carbon dioxide that the phytoplankton consumed. The dumping ignored the 1972 <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/ocean-dumping-international-treaties">London Convention and London Protocol</a> on preventing marine pollution and the Convention on Biological Diversity’s voluntary moratorium on ocean fertilization. The corporation <a href="http://www.haidasalmonrestoration.com/index.php/science/scientific-data">released the data</a> from the experiment and claims that a subsequent phytoplankton bloom created bigger salmon hauls the following year. Independent scientists, however, say it is <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/haida-gwaii-ocean-fertalizing-chile-1.3550783">unclear what impact</a> the fertilization had on the salmon population, and whether the bloom resulted in any long-term carbon storage.</p>
