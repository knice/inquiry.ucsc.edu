  <figcaption>The Gram stain, named after microbiologist Hans Christian Gram, differentiates bacteria based on their uptake of a violet-colored dye. Gram-positive bacteria have a cell wall component that retains the dye, so they appear violet, while Gram-negative cells don&#39;t, but can be counterstained with red. In this microscopic image of dental plaque, the Gram-positive bacteria are purple and Gram-negative appear red. Image courtesy of Jessica Morgan</figcaption>

<p>Examples of Gram-negative bacteria that deploy the type III secretion system to cause disease in people:</p>

<p><i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i> is usually harmless but some strains cause food poisoning which can be severe enough to cause death.</p>

<p><i>Chlamydia,</i> which causes the sexually transmitted disease of the same name.</p>

<p><i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> can cause serious infection in people with cystic fibrosis, severe burns, or weakened immune systems. Commonly blamed for hospital-acquired infections, it often lives on the surfaces of medical equipment.</p>

<p><i>Salmonella</i> can lead to typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and food poisoning.</p>

<p><i>Shigella,</i> which causes shigellosis, or bacillary dysentery, is one of the leading bacterial causes of diarrhea worldwide.</p>

<p><i>Yersinia pestis</i> causes bubonic plague, responsible for multiple pandemics throughout history.</p>

<p>Other <i>Yersinia</i> strains including <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</i>.</p>
