  <figcaption>The basic architecture of Rolandi&#39;s bioprotonic devices is similar to that of conventional field effect transistors. A gate contact, where external voltage can be applied to modulate current, is separated by an insulating layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) from palladium hydride (PdHx) source and drain contacts, which inject and collect, respectively, protons from a conducting channel. The channel is composed of one of two varieties of chitosan (a derivative of chitin): maleic chitosan, which transports H+, or proline chitosan, which transports OH- (the equivalent of a proton &quot;hole&quot;). The entire apparatus is only a few microns wide, about one-twentieth the width of a human hair. On the right is a magnified image of the chitosan fibers.
