With the expertise of scientists-turned-journalists, nine graduates of the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication Program reported these stories about scientific research that span the university&#39;s departments. While the UC Santa Cruz scientists may keep offices and laboratories on the redwood tree-studded campus, the impact of their work reaches around the worldâ€”and beyond.

At a time when the credibility of science and the news media is under scrutiny, the Science Communication Program is more important than ever, said Erika Check Hayden, the program&#39;s new director. &quot;Through our students, alums, and instructors, we have a huge role to play in promoting well-informed dialogue on science,&quot;
she said.

The &quot;SciCom&quot; graduate certificate program was established in 1981 by alum John Wilkes (B.A., M.A., and Ph.D.), a scholar in English literature with a plan to teach scientists how to skillfully extract and create readable stories from the realms of scientific study. His successor, a freelance science writer and former Wilkes&#39; student himself, Robert Irion (SciCom &#39;88) expanded the program&#39;s resources and influence during his decade of directorship. Now, Check Hayden is leveraging her international investigative reporting credentials and seven years of experience as a SciCom instructor in social media to oversee the next generations of UC Santa Cruz&#39;s science-savvy writers.

Like the 300-plus SciCommies before them, the next graduates will fill posts at regional, national, and international media outlets to deliver science discoveries in print, radio, video, television, and formats we haven&#39;t yet imagined. Despite concerns about the current media climate, Check Hayden is optimistic about the future.

Although there&#39;s a perception that so-called fake news, with its sensationalism and click-ability, will overshadow real news, Check Hayden said: &quot;If we&#39;re doing our jobs as communicators, we&#39;ll be able to tell our stories in ways that resonate with readers, listeners, or viewers in ways that make true news far more compelling.&quot;

We hope you find compelling reading among the articles in this edition of inquiry@UC Santa Cruz.
