Informed consent for medical research participants didn&#39;t exist in 1951 when researchers took the cancerous cervical cells of Henrietta Lacks, a poor African American woman, and developed &quot;HeLa&quot; cell cultures for worldwide study.

By 2013, when scientists sequenced—and published—Lacks&#39; genome from those cells without the family&#39;s permission, it spotlighted ethics, race, gender, and justice in biomedical research. Further, the National Institutes of Health director described Lacks as a matriarch for her contribution to science; an irony that didn&#39;t escape many, including James Doucet-Battle, a UC Santa Cruz medical anthropologist.

&quot;Matriarchal societies are those in which women wield control over political and economic resources,&quot; said Doucet-Battle.
&quot;For Henrietta Lacks, and historically for African American women, that&#39;s not quite the case.&quot;

With Henrietta Lacks as a starting point, Doucet-Battle examined the social contract between society and government in his paper, &quot;Bioethical Matriarchy: Race, Gender, and the Gift in Genomic Research,&quot; published in Catalyst.

&quot;It&#39;s about answering whether there&#39;s a possibility of an ideal democratic form of citizenship, in which the obligations to give and receive are based not on sacrificial forms of exchange, but on egalitarian forms of exchange,&quot; he said.
