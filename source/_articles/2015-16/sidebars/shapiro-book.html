<h2>Resurrecting the Past?</h2>

<p>Shapiro's brand-new book, How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction, isn't a how-to manual.
 Making an exact copy of an extinct animal is impossible. But some day, an animal might be assembled with some of the genetic code from an extinct one.</p>

<p>The idea is controversial, scientifically difficult, maybe unattainable, and poses all kinds of quandaries. Yet it's worth exploring the ideas, the goals, the impacts and the ethics, said Shapiro.
 Her book disentangles current-day science from science fiction, and argues that reviving individual species is misguided and probably unethical.</p>

<p>But she sees value in resurrecting extinct traits to "help living species adapt to a changing environment," and to revitalize and restore ecosystems and biological interactions.</p>

<p>Shapiro is a faculty member of the UCSC Genomics Institute's Genome 10K Project, which aims "to understand how complex animal life evolved through changes in DNA and use this knowledge to become better stewards of the planet." The project is working toward assembling a collection of DNA sequences that represent the genomic diversity of 10,000 vertebrate species.</p>

<p>One of the possibilities, she said, is to identify mutations or diversity that once existed within a population, "and then come up with new technologies to reengineer these populations on the brink of extinction to contain diversity that's recently been lost."</p>

<p>"De-extinction could be a game changer for our modern conservation crisis and that is what makes the science potentially so useful," she concluded.</p>
