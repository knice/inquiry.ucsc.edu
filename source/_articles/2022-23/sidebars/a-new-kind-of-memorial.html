<h3>A new kind of memorial</h3>
<p markdown="span">If the mission bells go, what should replace them? That is perhaps the most exciting part of the current debate, asking sponsors, historians, and artists to re-think what a memorial could and should be. Instead of the classic “man on a horse,” can it be something more subtle, more responsive, more interactive? Professor and Chair of Latin American and Latino Studies <a href="https://lals.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=cathysue"><strong>Catherine Ramirez</strong></a> has <a href="https://boomcalifornia.org/2021/07/26/the-other-southland-missions-monuments-and-memory-in-tovaangar/">written about a possible model</a>: the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-07-23/momument-debate-honor-history-new-design-goodbye-guy-on-a-horse">Sleepy Lagoon Memorial</a> designed by Sandra De La Loza and Arturo Roma in Los Angeles County. The memorial, not yet funded, would commemorate the <a href="https://research.pomona.edu/zootsuit/en/trial/">Sleepy Lagoon incident</a> of 1942, when, after a fight that left one youth dead, hundreds of Latino youths were arrested, many not even present at the fight and detained solely for their appearance. In what remains the largest mass conviction in California history, 12 were convicted of murder and assault; five more on lesser charges. To commemorate this traumatic moment in Latino history, the proposed monument combines spaces for reflection (stumps to sit on, a whispering wall), places for strolling (a bridge with the inscription, “Dancing Feet Find Their Rhythm”), and abundant native plants. “Traditional monuments are objects,” Ramirez said. “The Sleepy Lagoon Memorial would be an ecosystem.”</p>
