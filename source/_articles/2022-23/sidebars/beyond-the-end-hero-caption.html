<figcaption markdown="span">Above: Artist and activist [Cannupa Hanska Luger](http://www.cannupahanska.com/) designed mirror shields to support protesters during front-line actions in 2016 against the multibillion interstate Dakota Access Pipeline project. To engage the global community in helping to protect his tribal lands and culture, Luger created a call to action in an [instructional video](https://vimeo.com/191394747) for how to build the shields out of low-cost materials. He estimates that people around the country made and sent more than 1,000 mirror shields to the Oceti Sakowin Camp near Standing Rock, ND.
