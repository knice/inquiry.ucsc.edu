In addition to serving students, the farm is open for the public to enjoy during daylight hours (and when allowed by the pandemic) and hosts events such as the Harvest Festival and the Strawberry and Justice Festival, the latter a free community event focused on food and social justice education. Additionally, the farm's Life Lab program hosts around 3,500 local school-children every year who visit the farm to learn things like where food comes from and how to choose and prepare delicious and nutritious meals.
