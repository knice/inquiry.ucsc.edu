<h3>Robotic salads</h3>
 <p markdown="span">Against the back wall of the Cowell Coffee Shop stands one of the most advanced pieces of dining technology in the world: a salad-making robot. The <a href="https://www.chowbotics.com/">Chowbotics</a> vending machine whirls precisely programmed paddles around to assemble colorful, delicious bowls of fresh greens and chopped produce, each served exactly as ordered by its button-pushing customers.</p>
 <p markdown="span">“As fast as we stock it, it sells out,” said <a href="https://agroecology.ucsc.edu/about/staff-directory.html"><strong>Brooks Schmitt</strong></a>, the Cowell Coffee Shop Food Supervisor. “You wouldn’t believe how excited people get about kale when it’s coming out of a robot.”</p>
 <p markdown="span">As the popularity of the Cowell Coffee Shop grew, Schmitt began looking for more efficient, food-safe ways to serve customers fresh, nutritious meals. When he learned about Chowbotics, “I thought this is a great solution and also a great way to get students excited about salad,” he said.</p>
 <p markdown="span">Since its installation in the 2021 fall quarter, the salad robot has become a hit, serving 30 to 40 bowls a day. “Almost every single ingredient is grown on the campus farm,” Schmitt said. He hopes to place more of the robots around campus and sees them as a way to provide a healthy food option for students, especially during times when accessing fresh food becomes more difficult, like during finals or between quarters. “It’s a really powerful piece of technology,” he said. “What we’re doing in the agroecology department is absolutely cutting edge.”</p>

UCSC was the first UC campus to install any kind of automated food robot. “When we went through the steps to get the unit approved, some inspectors were a little surprised because they said cutting-edge tech like this usually rolls out on other UC campuses, like UCLA or Berkeley,” said Cowell Coffee House Food Supervisor Brooks Schmitt. But Schmitt and the Basic Needs team knew the Chowbotics unit would be a hit at UCSC, a research campus with a productive organic farm and programs aimed at connecting students to their food.
