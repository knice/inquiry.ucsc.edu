<figcaption markdown="span">Above: Woolly mammoths like the ones depicted here once roamed the icy northern plains of Eurasia and North America. However, the last one died more than 4,000 years ago, making it near impossible to use conventional genetics-based methods to trace the evolution and natural history of these elephant ancestors. Today, rapidly advancing technology and genetic techniques developed by UC Santa Cruz scientists and others have made peering into the past---of mammoths and all other creatures, including humans---a much more feasible research proposition.
