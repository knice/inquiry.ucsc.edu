<figcaption markdown="span">Above: On their weekend days off, manong agricultural workers often gathered for picnics to barbeque, socialize, and unwind from their grueling labor in the fields. During oral history interviews for "Watsonville is in the Heart," a "community-driven public history initiative to preserve and uplift stories of Filipino migration and labor in the city of Watsonville and greater Pajaro Valley," manong descendants shared fond childhood memories of going to such picnics and being doted on by many bachelor "uncles" in the community who became family by association. Kneeling on the far left in this 1930s photograph is Mamerto \"Max\" Sulay, father of Juanita Sulay Wilson.
