<figcaption markdown="span">Above: Behind a banner for the ecosexual movement they co-founded, Professor of Art Elizabeth "Beth" Stephens (second from right) and her wife Annie Sprinkle (far left) march in the 2015 San Francisco Pride Parade. The couple's latest documentary film, *Water Makes Us Wet*, follows Beth, Annie, and their dog Butch as they travel around the United States to explore the history and politics of water through an ecosexual lens. The film captures the protagonists meeting with water experts and activists, investigating Nestle's shady water bottling business, hobnobbing with elephant seals, and even plunging a toilet.
