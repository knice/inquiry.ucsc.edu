<h3>Popping up produce</h3>
 <p markdown="span">No, this isn’t a just-for-fun college scavenger hunt: Where on the UCSC campus might a student find a freshly picked delicata squash? At a <a href="https://basicneeds.ucsc.edu/resources/on-campus-food.html">Produce Pop-Up</a>, a farmstand offering low-cost organic veggies and fruit from the campus farm as well as local growers. The stands set up twice a week when classes are in session, at Quarry Plaza on Wednesdays, Porter Quad on Fridays.</p>
 <p markdown="span">“Our goal is to spread access to our food around campus,” said <a href="https://agroecology.ucsc.edu/about/profiles/francis-ge.html"><strong>Francis Ge</strong></a>, Basic Needs Coordinator at the UCSC Center for Agroecology. The program operates the Pop-Ups as an important resource for the entire campus community, Ge said, “like a library or gym.” Each week, Ge and her team of student coordinators and interns gather seasonal produce from the farm and round that out with wholesale purchases from the local farmer’s market. Some Pop-Up produce is free; the rest sells for half the cost, or less, of its supermarket prices.</p>

 <p markdown="span">For students without the wheels to forage off-campus, especially if they are receiving monthly electronic benefits from the government-funded <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calfresh">CalFresh</a> assistance program, the Pop-Ups are a lifesaver. “There’s nowhere on campus to use those benefits,” said Ge, “except a Produce Pop-Up.”</p>
