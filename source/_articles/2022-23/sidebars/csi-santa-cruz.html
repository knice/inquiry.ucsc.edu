<h3>CSI: Santa Cruz</h3>
<p markdown="span">In 1980, an off-duty police officer and his brother discovered the body of a murder victim on the side of the road in Henderson, Nevada. She became known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Tammy_Terrell">Arroyo Grande Jane Doe</a>,” and for decades investigators had no leads on who she was or how she was killed. Then, in 2019, a clip of her hair made its way to <a href="https://www.astreaforensics.com/">Astrea Forensics</a>, a Santa Cruz&ndash;based startup headed by chief executive officer (CEO) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-harkins-claretbio/"><strong>Kelly Harkins Kincaid</strong></a>, a former postdoc of Ed Green’s in the Paleogenomics Laboratory.</p>

<p markdown="span">In May 2017, after he first applied his expertise in assembling DNA to <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/05/miranda-eve.html">determine the identity of an unknown body</a>, Green <a href="https://genomics.ucsc.edu/2019/09/18/why-this-scientist-keeps-receiving-packages-of-serial-killers-hair/">started receiving dozens of phone calls</a> from law enforcement agencies requesting help in analyzing crime scene DNA. It turns out the same techniques that can piece together degraded DNA from ancient bones also make powerful tools for reassembling the minuscule amounts of DNA present in hair, skin, or semen samples from years-old crime scenes. Prompted by this interest, Green and Harkins Kincaid founded Astrea, with Arroyo Grande Jane Doe’s murder the first crime addressed by the company. In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/02/us/nevada-victim-identified-cold-case-homicide/index.html">late 2021</a>, the Henderson Police Department announced that, thanks in part to the Astrea sequencing, they’d finally put a name to the victim: Tammy Corrine Terrell.</p>
<p markdown="span">“I realized that I really liked thinking about what these technologies could be applied to other than ancient DNA,” said Harkins Kincaid, who also wears the founding CEO hat of <a href="https://www.claretbio.com/">Claret Bioscience</a>, which employs some of the same Paleogenomics Lab techniques to help process degraded DNA in blood sampled for medical testing.</p>
