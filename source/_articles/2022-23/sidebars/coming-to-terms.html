<h3>Coming to terms</h3>
<p markdown="span">In the past several decades, <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/genomicresearch/genomeediting/#:~:text=Genome%20editing%20(also%20called%20gene,particular%20locations%20in%20the%20genome.)---most">gene-editing technologies</a> recently and notably the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/press-release/">2020 Nobel Prize</a>&ndash;winning <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/questions-and-answers-about-crispr">CRISPR</a> (shorthand for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)—have become mainstream laboratory tools, used by scientists to re-engineer the genomes of animals, plants, and even <a href="https://innovativegenomics.org/news/crispr-clinical-trials-2022/">human patients</a>. For some people, the idea of purposefully altering an organism’s genome sounds like spooky science fiction or a recipe for disaster. For Professor Beth Shapiro, however, it sounds like what humans have already done for 50,000 years. “Humans have been changing other species as long as we’ve existed,” she said, “in all sorts of both accidental and very purposeful ways.”</p>
<p markdown="span">This history, Shapiro said, is typically not appreciated by people wary of new genetic technologies. In her recently published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Made-Innovation-Refined-Redefined-Nature-ebook/dp/B08W4ZK8BY"><em>Life as We Made It</em></a> (Basic Books, 2021), she details the long history of how humans have shaped nature and continue to do so. She also seeks to counteract misinformation about the capabilities of genomic engineering. “If we want a future that is both biodiverse and filled with people,” she said, “we must come to terms with these biotechnologies.”</p>

Writing the book, Shapiro said, was a welcome distraction from the pandemic. Credit: Basic Books (public domain).
