<h3>Erasing the silence</h3>
<p markdown="span">One question that people who want to take down a monument always confront is: “Aren’t you erasing history?” Associate Professor of History <a href="https://history.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/index.php?uid=catjones"><strong>Catherine Jones</strong></a> turns the question around: “What does this monument silence?” The Confederate monuments silenced Black people, who were invisible in those monuments, and they also silenced white dissenters. “They denied the fact that there were many people in the South who opposed slavery and fought fiercely to end it,” Jones said. Similarly, the mission bells silenced the experience of California Indians, still struggling to be heard after 150 years.</p>

<p markdown="span">Both kinds of monuments also had mercenary objectives. In Richmond, Virginia, the sponsors of the Confederate statues on <a href="https://onmonumentave.com/">Monument Avenue</a> built them as part of a plan to market the area as a desirable white neighborhood. In California, sponsors of the mission bells placed them to encourage tourism to the cities that grew up around the 21 former missions. But these bells are as fake as the mission bells in Taco Bell advertisements. Though such memorials convey some historical meaning, it is typically not the one intended. “Monuments tell us more about the time when they were built,” said Daisy Martin, “than the events they are supposed to memorialize.”</p>
