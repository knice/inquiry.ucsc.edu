<figcaption markdown="span">Above: The Liverpool, UK&ndash;based [ADHD Foundation](https://www.adhdfoundation.org.uk/) organizes the [Neurodiversity Umbrella Project](https://www.adhdfoundation.org.uk/what-we-do/umbrella-project/). Thousands of colorful umbrellas are hung over schools, public places, and business buildings in cities across the UK. The aim is to celebrate the gifts, talents, and strengths of [neurodivergent](https://www.neurodiversityhub.org/what-is-neurodiversity) people who have been diagnosed with conditions such as [autism](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd), [ADHD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html), [dyslexia](https://dyslexia.yale.edu/dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia/), and [Tourette syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/tourette/facts.html). The project aims to change perceptions of neurodivergent people by accepting and celebrating differences.
