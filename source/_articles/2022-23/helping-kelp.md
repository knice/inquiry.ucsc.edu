In 2014, [Kelp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp), an iconic feature of coastal California, started dying---and kept dying. Per a [UC Santa Cruz-led study published in 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01827-6), the once lush forests of this bulb-topped, giant algae off the California coast had, by 2019, receded by more than 95%. Taking their place? A barren sea floor crawling with spiny [sea urchins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin).

Historical records indicate that kelp abundance cycles with environmental conditions, typically declining as coastal waters warm. But the latest die-off appears poised for persistence. An atypically dogged warm water mass lasting from 2014 to 2016 ([nicknamed "The Blob"](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/blob#:~:text=By%20summer%20of%202014%2C%20the,couple%20of%20weeks%20before%20dissipating.)) likely initiated the kelp decline. But then, a strong [El Ni√±o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tuou_QcgxI) followed. The unusually extended warming exacerbated disease-related die-offs of the [sea stars](https://aqua.org/explore/animals/sea-stars) that eat urchins. Not surprisingly, the numbers of purple sea urchins---the voracious primary predators of kelp---exploded. How long this possibly climate change-related ecological upset will last is unclear. "I think the kelp will return," said Professor **[Peter Raimondi](https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/about/dept-directory.php?uid=raimondi), who co-leads the coastal ecosystem-focused** [[Raimondi-Carr Lab]{.underline}](https://rclab.ucsc.edu/) with Professor [**Mark Carr**](https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/about/dept-directory.php?uid=mhcarr). "The more important question is will such die-offs become more common."

In a step towards potentially helping kelp to recover, Raimondi's genetics-based research has identified kelp subpopulations adapted to thrive at different water temperatures. If coastal policy called for human intervention, Raimondi said, "You could theoretically restore kelp populations from a "seed bank" with stock adapted to current or expected temperature ranges."
