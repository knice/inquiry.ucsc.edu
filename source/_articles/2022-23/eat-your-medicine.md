When Professor [**Nancy N. Chen**](https://anthro.ucsc.edu/about/directory/academic-personnel/index.php?uid=nchen) feels a cold coming on, she prepares a pot of fresh garlic, ginger, honey, and lemon tea. Making sure to inhale the steam from the smashed---not chopped---garlic, she drinks the brew all day. For Chen, a medical anthropologist, food stands at the frontline of healing and she "eats her medicine."

How food, medicine, and culture intersect animates Chen's research. The notion that food can heal is not new---"These concepts have been around for centuries," Chen said. Building on this knowledge, Chen partnered with [**Kellee Matsushita-Tseng**](https://agroecology.ucsc.edu/about/profiles/kellee-matsushita.html), assistant manager of the UCSC Farm Garden, to mentor and support students in the [Global and Community Health Wellbeing Fellows](https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/gch/global-health-awards/) program while they tend the [Center for Agroecology](https://agroecology.ucsc.edu/)'s newly revitalized Community Herb Garden. The work, Chen said, aims to reconnect BIPOC students to their ancestral heritages via food and herbal cultivation, as well as through "active engagement" with the soil, each other, and local communities.

Chen's scholarship facilitates her role, since 2018, as the [Division of Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/)' [Associate Dean for Health, Wellbeing, and Society](https://anthro.ucsc.edu/news/news-articles/chen_health_dean.html). The pandemic has highlighted the importance of good health, said Chen. "My hope is that people become more mindful about the health benefits of eating for long-term wellbeing."
