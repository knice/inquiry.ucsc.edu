On September 20, 2018, some 50 Bay Area dance artists, choreographers, educators, funders, and administrators gathered in Oakland for a "long-table discussion." On the table? A social justice issue still unacknowledged by most in dance---racial inequity. The Oakland public forum, the first of many around the country, kick-started *[Dancing Around Race](https://www.bridgeproject.art/dancing-around-race-public-dialogues),* a community engagement project sponsored by [Hope Mohr Dance](https://www.hopemohr.org/company), a dance organization dedicated to "creating and supporting embodied art and social change."

At the center of the conversations stood their lead organizer, [**Gerald Casel**](https://theater.ucsc.edu/faculty/gerald-casel), a person whose lived experience gives him first-hand knowledge of dance's racialized issues and the skills and drive to do something about it. Casel wears many hats: queer, Filipino immigrant, first-gen college graduate, highly accomplished dance artist, award-winning performance maker, cultural and community activist. Casel, formerly an associate professor of theater arts, recently left UCSC to become chair of the Dance Department at Rutgers University.

Insights from **Dancing Around Race** now extend into workshops Casel is piloting, as well as teaching modules for higher education and K--12 performing arts curricula, all directed at facilitating candid discussions in brave spaces. "It's the system that's racist, not necessarily the people," Casel said. "There's a lot of potentially problematic issues around appropriation, tokenism, and cultural mismatch---we want to unpack all that and talk about it rather than pretend it doesn't exist."
