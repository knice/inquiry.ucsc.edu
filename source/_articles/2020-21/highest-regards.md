When [**Cynthia Larive**](https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/about/) began her
tenure at UC Santa Cruz in July 2019 as the new chancellor, she already
knew she was joining a university with a commitment to impactful
research. But a few months into the job, she got a reminder of just how
highly the university is regarded. In November, the [Association of
American Universities](https://www.aau.edu/) (AAU), an exclusive group
of universities at the forefront of research and academics, named UCSC
as one of its newest members.

"AAU membership is such a great recognition of the ongoing contributions
of our faculty, students, and staff," said Larive.

The AAU includes only 65 member universities, chosen based on factors
including faculty citations and awards, research funding, and commitment
to undergraduate and graduate education. Together, AAU members work to
shape educational policy at both institutional and national levels.

UCSC is one of the youngest schools invited to join the AAU, and one of
only 15 without a medical school. "To be a university that does not have
a medical school and be admitted to the AAU is really something to be
proud of," said Larive. The university's strong focus on
interdisciplinary research, undergraduate student success, and diversity
and inclusion all help it stand out, she said.

Larive is no stranger to what it takes to run a successful research
enterprise. At UC Riverside, Larive was both a professor of chemistry
and served as provost and executive vice chancellor. Her research
involved developing improved tools for chemical analysis used to study
everything from human biology to food&mdash;one project had her
characterizing the compounds in pomegranate juice.

"I've been involved in many collaborative research projects and worked
with people who weren't chemists to tackle important and complex
problems," said Larive, "And this informs the way I think about things."
This big picture perspective that she's such a fan of is already
prevalent at UCSC, she said, and [AAU membership is a prestigious, very
public confirmation of this](https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/11/aau.html). In
recent years UCSC researchers have come together to launch large-scale,
cutting-edge initiatives in genomics, global climate change, coastal
policy, and agroecology, to name just a few.

Moving forward, Larive plans to fully support UCSC faculty in their
hands-on approach to shaping the university's research program&mdash;they're
the ones who can spot areas ripe for new research and collaborations,
she said. "We're on a great trajectory already."
