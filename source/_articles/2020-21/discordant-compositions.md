Poets consider music to be humankind's universal language. But deep
divides of race and income at times split its makers&mdash;at least those
who were members of the [American Federation of
Musicians](https://www.afm.org/) (AFM)---in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.
[**Leta Miller**](https://music.ucsc.edu/people/leta-miller), professor
emerita of music, discovered a piece of this [troubled
past](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-society-for-american-music/article/racial-segregation-and-the-san-francisco-musicians-union-192360/AF0DDC13BFB01F3B76E11C881103F85B)
in San Francisco's history, where black and white musicians formed
separate, competing union local chapters.

The conflict in San Francisco came to a head in 1934 when the black
Local 648 sued their white counterpart, Local 6, for attempting to
control all gigs. State laws eventually forced the two to merge in 1960.
But Miller found that similarly segregated union locals were commonplace
across dozens of U.S. cities&mdash;and some even persisted into the early
1970s. "I was quite astonished at how many there were," Miller said.

Supported by a [2019--2020 Dickson Emeriti
professorship](https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/06/dickson-emeriti-professors.html), Miller is now working on a book about segregation in musicians' unions
across the nation. While the separation was no doubt rooted in racism,
black musicians in many cases actually chose to form their own locals.
Miller found that, apart from promoting identity and community, doing so
allowed them to set their own rates&mdash;sometimes undercutting the white
competition. Each local also garnered a seat at the AFM national
convention, so "having their own local ensured that black musicians were
guaranteed a voice at the meeting," Miller said. "That was probably very
important."
