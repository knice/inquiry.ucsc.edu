Aquaculture is a booming business. In 2014, for the first time in modern
history, people ate more aquaculture-produced seafood---[[roughly 74
million tonnes]{.underline}](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf)---than
seafood harvested from capture fisheries. Due to increasing demand for
seafood products and depleted wild fish stocks, farmed seafood has
become [[the world's fastest growing food
sector]{.underline}](http://www.fao.org/aquaculture/en/). And as our
global population increases, so will our dependence on aquaculture to
feed a world filled with billions more hungry people.

Program]{.underline}](https://csp.ucsc.edu/), seeks to develop fish-free
feeds that contain marine microalgae instead. Credit: C. Lagattuta.</figcaption>
</figure>
But farmed seafood faces the same long-term sustainability problem as
capture fisheries: dwindling stocks of wild fish. Fish farming
operations depend on smaller wild fish, like anchovies, sardines, and
mackerel, to feed the larger fish that end up on our dinner plates.
These smaller species---called "forage fish"---live lower on the food
chain where they provide an important base of the marine food web,
critically supporting everything from larger fish to marine mammals and
seabirds. According to a 2017
[report](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/faf.12209)
published in the journal *Fish and Fisheries*, of all fish caught in the
world, about 20 million tonnes (90% of which could be eaten by humans)
are ground up to produce fishmeal and fish oil, primarily to feed farmed
fish. At that rate, experts worry that the [[demand could outstrip the
supply as soon as
2037]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0077-1),
with additional severe consequences for marine ecosystems that are
already threatened. "Is aquaculture really adding to world fish supplies
or is it actually helping deplete wild fisheries?" asked food security
expert [[Rosamond
Naylor]{.underline}](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/rosamond_l_naylor),
a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University in Palo Alto.

Humans farm more than [[580 species of aquatic animals and
plants]{.underline}](http://www.fao.org/aquaculture/en/), everything
from fish, oysters, and clams, to shrimp and seaweed. This flourishing
enterprise provides roughly 50 percent of the seafood currently consumed
by people. In the early 2000s, fishery products were the primary protein
source for [[some 950 million
people]{.underline}](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/eacc/f64597ca8812aeca4dd40854ee76737fb57b.pdf),
a number that is certainly much higher today. Aquaculture is clearly
necessary and important to feed populations all over the world. The good
news is that, compared to producing beef, pork, and chicken, aquaculture
is more efficient and emits the lowest amount of greenhouse gases. But
it could and should be better, and that's the goal of UC Santa Cruz
professor of environmental studies [**[Anne
Kapuscinski]{.underline}**](https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=akapusci).

"Aquaculture started over 2,000 years ago in China, and also arose in
some other parts of the world. It actually mimicked natural ecosystems
in that there wasn't any waste," said Kapuscinski. Armed with this
knowledge, Kapuscinski wants to steer aquaculture in a more sustainable
direction that eliminates the need for wild-caught forage fish and
reduces waste. To do that, she's been experimenting with using
microscopic marine algae as the basis for healthy,
environmentally-friendly fish feeds that swap out the fishmeal and fish
oil.

Kapuscinski's work to create a green and nutritionally superior
aquaculture sector with minimal environmental impact is "valuable and
progressive," said Naylor. There are "real opportunities for
improvement," she said, "and they are right there at UCSC---it's time to
find replacements for wild fishmeal."

## Nutritional nuances ##

The key to developing a fish-free feed is understanding fish nutrition.
You need to achieve the right balance of proteins and fats so the fish
grows as well, if not better, than they would on a conventional diet,
Kapuscinski said. At least [[40 essential
nutrients]{.underline}](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/feeds-aquaculture)
must be included in their diet, so it's no easy feat.

The menu for most farmed fish currently includes a mix of fishmeal and
fish oil. For a carnivorous species like salmon, fishmeal accounts for
about 25 percent of their food. Together, these ingredients are
chock-full of proteins, amino acids, and two critical [[omega-3 fatty
acids]{.underline}](http://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/fishery-information/resource-detail/en/c/1052098/),
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Walk into
any vitamin store or vitamin isle and you'll see myriad jars of fish oil
supplements. That's because research has linked these omega-3s to a
variety of human health benefits, including a decreased risk of heart
disease. In the wild, the DHA and EPA required by fish come from marine
microalgae. Fish and other marine organisms obtain these omega-3s by
directly eating marine microalgae, or by eating other animals that have
eaten the microalgae.

in cages like these in Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, Africa. Tilapia farming
currently uses feeds that contain substantial amounts of fishmeal and
fish oil derived from wild fish. Such feeds are wasteful and ultimately
unsustainable, and---as research performed by Kapuscinski and her team
is showing---can likely be replaced with more environmentally-friendly
fish-free feeds. Credit: [[M. Reantaso, courtesy of FAO Aquaculture

</figure>
To develop fish-free fish diets, Kapuscinski closely collaborates with
**[[Pallab
Sarker]{.underline}](https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/directory_researchers.php?uid=psarker),**
a fish nutrition expert and associate research professor of
environmental studies. Their goal is to replace the fish-derived
products in fish feed with marine microalgae, which hasn't been done
before. "Microalgae are a particularly good candidate for fish feed
because they are at the base of the aquatic food chains," said Sarker.
So far, the researchers' efforts have focused primarily on [[Nile
tilapia]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_tilapia), a
freshwater species---*Oreochromis niloticus*---native to the northern
half of Africa and Israel. After Chinese carps, tilapia constitute the
second most important group of farmed fish, and the most widely
cultivated.

Like that of farmed salmon and trout, the commercial diet of farmed
tilapia includes fishmeal and fish oil. However, unlike wild salmon and
trout, which are carnivores, wild tilapia occupy a lower level on the
food chain and don't eat fish. They primarily graze on mats of algae and
bacteria. Despite this, almost 20 percent of total world production of
fishmeal and fish oil from capture fisheries goes to support tilapia
farming, said Kapuscinski. "That's why I started our work with tilapia."
## Hand fed ##

Kapuscinski and Sarker's experiments involve feeding tilapia diets with
different compositions of fishmeal, fish oil, and algae. The fish are
first measured and weighed and then divided randomly into different
tanks where they receive one of the test diets. The fish are weighed
throughout the studies, and then again at the end, when tissue samples
are also taken. The team carefully feed the fish the test feed pellets
by hand, three times a day for 12 weeks. "We pay attention to make sure
that feed waste is minimized," said Sarker. "We distribute the feed to
the tank very slowly and ensure every pellet has been received by the
fish."

In a
[[study]{.underline}](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201315)
published in *PLOS One* (July 2018), the researchers fed the tilapia a
conventional diet and ones with fishmeal replaced by the microalga
*Nannochloropsis oculata* at 33 percent, 66 percent, and 100 percent
levels. The results showed that the protein-rich portion of the
microalgae could replace 33 percent of the fishmeal. "We were really
excited to find that the microalgae could replace a significant amount
of the fishmeal," Kapuscinski said.

research subject. Credit: [[Bjørn Christian

</figure>
In a more recent study, not yet published, Kapuscinski and Sarker
replaced both fishmeal and fish oil with two different species of
microalgae. This work showed that the replacement feed produces tilapia
better and faster than a conventional diet. In addition to measuring the
fish, the team also calculates the "feed conversion ratio" (FCR), an
estimate of the amount of feed that actually becomes fish flesh. The
lower the FCR the more efficient the feed, and the fish fed the algae
diets have a lower FCR. "Farmers keep using the fishmeal and fish oil
assuming the tilapia will do best with that," said Kapuscinski. "But
we've found that the fishmeal and fish oil aren't needed. With the two
types of marine microalgae together, we get a superior diet."

## Cost cutting ##

A big concern with using algae for fish feed is its potentially high
cost. Companies are already using less-expensive alternatives such as
soy, corn, and canola to reduce the fishmeal---which has become more
expensive---in their feeds. But these substitutes are not healthy for
fish or humans eating the fish, nor are they sustainable solutions. They
lack the omega-3s, have lower digestibility, and contain antinutrients,
compounds that actually interfere with nutrient absorption. For example,
the phosphorous in land-based crops is particularly difficult for fish
to digest, said Sarker. Seventy percent of the phosphorous remains
undigested, meaning increased pollution from the resulting sewage.

</figure>
Following the sustainability concept known as [[circular
economy]{.underline}](https://kapsar.sites.ucsc.edu/circular-economies-for-aquatic-food-systems/),
Kapuscinski and her team plan to keep the price tag of their algae-based
feed down by using what would otherwise be a waste product. Instead of
making their protein ingredients from whole algae, they're using
"defatted biomass"---the leftovers from whole algae first pressed for
other uses in the biofuel and nutraceutical industries. Because this
leftover algal meal currently serves no other purpose, the cost is low.

a circular economy, Kapuscinski and her team used wastewater from a
brewery to grow microalgae that might later be used in their
experimental fish feeds. Credit: Kapuscinski-Sarker Lab.</figcaption>
</figure>
Kapuscinski originally wanted to use the whole algae, but realized that
would not work economically, said [[Martin
Sabarsky]{.underline}](http://cellana.com/about-us/our-team/), CEO of
San Diego--based [[Cellana]{.underline}](http://cellana.com/), and a
collaborator with Kapuscinski's team on one current project. At the end
of the day, he said, you can have a perfect fish-free feed, but if
farmers can't afford it, it won't matter. "Anne is one of the first in
this space who thinks deeply about formulation with commercial scaling
in mind," Sabarsky said. "She's combining what would be a perfect
product with what could also work commercially." Naylor agreed: "Anne
and Pallab are rock stars in developing prototype feeds. They are
thoughtful both about the ingredient list and the economics. If whole
algae was the only revenue stream, you would not be able to
commercialize it."

## Salmon in sight ##

While most of their work to date has focused on tilapia, Kapuscinski and
Sarker have set their sights on another goal---to create a fish-free
feed for farmed trout, a member of the salmon family. The trout,
however, serve as a model for salmon, the ultimate prize. Touted for its
health benefits, salmon is one of the highest economic value fishes
produced in aquaculture, particularly for wealthy countries, like the
United States, Japan, and in Europe. And it's a big player. Global
aquaculture production of salmon is more than [[2 million
tonnes]{.underline}](http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Salmo_salar/en)
and gobbles up about [[25 percent and 50
percent]{.underline}](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfb.12224)
of the world's production of fishmeal and fish oil, respectively.
China---the world's largest aquaculture producer---now has plans to
[[farm millions of
salmon]{.underline}](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-02/26/c_137852335.htm)
in giant offshore pens in the middle of Yellow Sea, between mainland
China and the Korean Peninsula.
<figure class="" style="width:600px;">
  {% asset 2020/salmonffarm-in-scotland.jpg @magick:resize=600 alt:'Salmon farm in Scotland' %}<figcaption>As carnivores, salmon pose more of challenge for removing fishmeal and
fish oil from their farmed feed. Globally, salmon farms, like this one
in the sea at Loch Ainort off the Isle of Skye in Scotland, consume an
estimated half of all fishmeal, and a quarter of all fish oil produced
today. Credit: [[Richard Dorrell, Loch Ainort fish

</figure>
The big difference between tilapia and salmon is that salmon sit higher
on the food chain in the wild. Salmon are mid-tier predators that eat
small fish and invertebrates, which makes the idea of feeding them a
vegan diet somewhat illogical. This makes replacing the fishmeal and
fish oil in salmon feed more of a challenge than doing so in feeds for
tilapia. But it's also a challenge from Kapuscinski's green perspective.
"The planet just beautifully produces salmon. If I had a magic wand and
could change the world, I would steer us away from raising farmed salmon
and instead put all that effort and financial resources into restoring
wild salmon populations," Kapuscinski said. "But I'm also a pragmatist
and realize that you can't just do that."

Sarker and Kapuscinski's initial
[[results]{.underline}](https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.404/)
in reducing the fish products in feeds for rainbow trout are promising.
While trout fed a fish-free diet had slightly lower growth rates
compared to those fed a conventional diet, the fillets from both
contained similar levels of DHA, the important omega-3. "This is an
exciting opportunity to potentially achieve fish-free trout feed with
improved growth performance and palatability," said Sarker.

And while the UCSC research focuses on microalgae, it could turn out to
be just one part of the optimal fish-free feed solution. It's possible
that future fish-free feeds, whether for tilapia or salmon, could
contain a combination of microalgae and other sustainable products like
insect meal, bacteria, and yeast. "There are other innovators both in
the private sector and the research community, who are trying to develop
many other alternative ingredients," said Kapuscinski, whose team is
developing an [[open-access, decision-support
tool]{.underline}](https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/kapuscinski-noaa.html)
to compare alternative and conventional fish-feed ingredients for their
nutritional value, environmental impacts, and cost competitiveness.

Wild may still be preferred by those who can afford it, but aquaculture
promises to be an important part of our future, thanks to the
enlightened efforts of Kapuscinski and others for whom sustainability
provides purpose. "Aquaculture can add net value to our food systems,"
Kapuscinski said. "It can be regenerative in helping to improve
environmental quality, but it needs to be done in a circular economy
way. We need to think mindfully about how to link aquaculture with other
production systems, to recycle and reuse nutrients and material."
