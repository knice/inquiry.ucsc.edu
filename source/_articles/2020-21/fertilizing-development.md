In the fight against global poverty, rigorous field research can provide
important insights. This conclusion determined the [2019 Nobel Prize in
Economic
Sciences](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2019/10/press-economicsciences2019-2.pdf),
awarded to three researchers---Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and
Michael Kremer---for their pioneering efforts in applying this approach
to the study of economics in developing countries. This rigorous,
quantitative methodology also drives the work of associate professor and
development economist [**Jonathan
Robinson**](https://economics.ucsc.edu/faculty/ladder-faculty.php?uid=jmrtwo).

Robinson's collaborative research with Duflo and Kremer, among others,
focuses on understanding why potentially life-changing agricultural
practices remain little used in many impoverished areas. For example,
while the use of fertilizer has increased dramatically in countries like
India, smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa haven't followed suit.
The weak uptake there may be due to different environments and crops
grown, or inadequate education, but another barrier could be the high
cost of access related to poor infrastructure.Â 

In a [recent study](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jmrtwo/market_access.pdf),
Robinson and collaborators quantified how poor roads and distance from a
fertilizer retailer correlate with decreased fertilizer usage and
individual farmer productivity in Tanzania. Their results directly
connect the increased costs of obtaining fertilizer for farmers in more
remote villages with reduced earnings from what they grow. "Farmers
ultimately choose to adopt inputs like fertilizer based on
profitability," Robinson said. "Even if fertilizer increases yields,
farmers may reject it because the costs of access are too high."
