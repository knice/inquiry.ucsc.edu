fossil fuel production, can trigger earthquakes. Here, graduate student

Modern methods of extracting fossil fuel from the ground also bring up
vast amounts of highly contaminated water. The safest way to dispose of
that toxic wastewater is to pump it back underground, but that can
disturb faults and trigger earthquakes. "People make earthquakes by
shoving water into the ground or by pulling water out," said professor
of Earth and planetary sciences and induced seismology expert [**Emily
Brodsky**](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/emily_brodsky/), who
has made it her mission to understand this phenomenon.

To more closely investigate how wastewater injection triggers
earthquakes, Brodsky and then researcher and lecturer [**Thomas
Goebel**](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~tgoebel/) (now an assistant
professor at the University of Memphis) analyzed data from 18 drill
sites around the world. Their
[findings](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6405/899),
published in the prestigious journal *Science* (August 2018), overturned
conventional wisdom about the safest place to inject wastewater. Oil
companies typically avoid injecting into deeper, harder basement rock
that contains most seismic faults, opting instead for shallower, softer
sedimentary rock. Brodsky and Goebel's evaluation of injection depths
and affected rock types revealed that the sedimentary strategy triggered
more earthquakes and ones of higher magnitude. "Sedimentary injections
are more dangerous than basement injections, the opposite of what
everyone thought," Brodsky said.

Sedimentary injections can transmit pressure up to 10 kilometers away,
increasing the chances of disturbing faults. Oil companies are better
off injecting into basement rock, especially if they can pinpoint areas
free of major faults, Brodsky said.
