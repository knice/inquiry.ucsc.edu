<p>For more than 2,500 years in southeast China, farmers have grown mulberry trees. Leaves from the trees feed the silkworms they raise to produce silk. The silkworm &quot;frass&quot;---insect poop&mdash;feeds fish in nearby ponds, and humans eat the fish. Every winter, the farmers collect the nutrient-rich mud from the bottom of the fishponds and use it to fertilize the mulberry orchards. This circular system, called the <a href="http://www.fao.org/giahs/giahsaroundtheworld/designated-sites/asia-and-the-pacific/huzhou-mulberry-dyke-fish-pond-system/detailed-information/en/">Zhejiang Huzhou Mulberry-dyke &amp; Fish-pond System</a>, reduces waste and sustainably integrates agriculture and aquaculture.</p>
<p>Humans have farmed fish for a long time. The practice arose
independently in several locations around the world, including ancient
China, Egypt, and Hawaii. The ancient Egyptians farmed fish in ponds
along the Nile, as documented in a bas-relief found in a 4,000-year old
Egyptian tomb. The Nile tilapia&mdash;one of the world&#39;s most widely farmed
fishes&mdash;was so important that it had its own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyph">hieroglyph</a>,
also the symbol for fertility.</p>
<p>&quot;In these ancient systems, you always see the recycling of what we in our modern world would consider waste,&quot; said Kapuscinski. Aquaculture was never done on its own, but rather, it was coupled in a systematic way with agriculture and capture fisheries. For example, in Hawaii, villages would raise small fish in ponds and lagoons, with fishing managed by the village chief. When wild fish were spawning, he would close fishing in open waters and only allow fish harvesting from the ponds.</p>
<p>The key to a sustainable future in aquaculture is modeling these systems of the past to reduce and recycle waste and adopt integrated systems, said Kapuscinski. &quot;We need to try to understand how we might apply these principles&mdash;given modern conditions&mdash;in the present.&quot;</p>
