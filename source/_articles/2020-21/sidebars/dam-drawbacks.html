<p>At the turn of the 19th century, the Khazan Aswan Dam was the largest
dam ever built. Today, large dams span many of the world&#39;s rivers. Some
57,000 surpass 15 meters in height, according to <a href="https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/about-international-rivers-3679">[International
Rivers</a>,
an Oakland, CA--based global advocacy group focused on protecting
rivers. Of these large dams, more than 300 are giants topping 150 meters
and restraining enormous reservoirs. Now built primarily to produce
hydropower, these huge dams cause vast changes to rivers, their
surrounding landscapes, and the ecosystems they support. And more are
coming: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00027-014-0377-0">[At least 3,700 major
dams</a>,
each with a power-generating capacity of more than 1 megawatt, are
either planned or under construction, mostly in countries with emerging
economies.</p>

already in place and others planned, are threatening fisheries and farms
along the lower Mekong River in Vietnam and Cambodia. These livelihoods,
and the way of life they support, depend on the flooding caused by the
August-to-November monsoon rains that fill the rivers of Southeast Asia
and broaden the water covering the Mekong River Delta well beyond its
dry season footprint. These false-color space images from 2004 contrast
the lower Mekong River immediately before the start of the monsoon rains
(left, July 5) and at its flood stage (right, September 21). In false
color, vegetation is bright green, water is blue and black, and clouds
are light blue. The flood waters hide the river&#39;s normal channel and
obscure the vast Tonlé Sap Lake seen in the pre-flood image. Credit:

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekong">[Mekong River</a>,
for example, has its headwaters in China and flows 4,350 km through
Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam before reaching the South
China Sea. One of the world&#39;s richest freshwater fisheries, the Mekong
supports more migratory fish than any other river in the world, said
<a href="https://www.stimson.org/ppl/eyler/">[Brian Eyler</a>, the
director of the Southeast Asia program at the <a href="https://www.stimson.org/">[Stimson
Center</a> in Washington, DC. Along
with fish, the river transports organic material that forms the basis of
the food web, as well as sediment that provides nutrients for
agriculture. &quot;Dams block all that,&quot; said Eyler, author the 2019 book,
<a href="https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/last-days-of-the-mighty-mekong/"><em>[The Last Days of the Mighty
Mekong</em></a>.</p>
<p>Dozens of dams currently dot the Mekong, with many more in the works.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xayaburi_Dam">[Xayaburi
Dam</a>, a large
dam in Laos, started operating in October 2019; in Laos alone, 64 more
dams are under construction on the Mekong and its tributaries.
Downstream communities already experience a substantially altered river,
with reports of extreme changes in water levels and clarity. Further
south in Cambodia, the Mekong seasonally reversed the flow of the Tonlé
Sap River into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonl%C3%A9_Sap">[Tonlé Sap
Lake</a>,
greatly swelling its size with water from the annual monsoons. The lake
would then contract, a seasonal heartbeat that the dams---along with
climate change---have now crippled, greatly reducing the lake&#39;s size,
said Eyler. The largest source of freshwater fish in the world, Tonlé
Sap once provided 70 percent of the protein for the people living
nearby. Now fisherman can no longer depend on regular catches, and
locals go hungry.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, Eyler said, alternatives to dams are increasingly
viable. Countries there have started to develop other renewable energy
resources like solar and wind; Vietnam now generates more than 5
gigawatts from solar. &quot;Electric demand can be met in other ways,&quot; Eyler
said. &quot;These dams don&#39;t need to be built.&quot;</p>
