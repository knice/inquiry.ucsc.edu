<p>California needed mercury to become the golden state. A key ingredient
in placer mining, mercury was churned out during the Gold Rush era by
almost 40 major mines between Santa Barbara and the Oregon border.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://explore.museumca.org/creeks/z-mercurymines.html">New Almaden Quicksilver
Mines</a>,
established in 1847, was the biggest of these mining operations, located
12 miles from downtown San Jose. Here, miners extracted 82 million
pounds of mercury, most of it by 1905, from the red mercury sulfide ore,
known as cinnabar, dug from the mines. Heated in a furnace, the mercury
in the cinnabar became a gas. Then cooled and condensed, the vapor
became quicksilver. Leftover rock was dumped around the mine, including
into streams draining into the San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>After a brief boom in the 1960s with mercury back in demand during the
Vietnam War---it was used in explosives---cinnabar mining in California
finally stopped in the 1970s, due to rising operating costs and
environmental regulations. Today, <a href="https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=17361&amp;inline">after extensive clean-up of
contaminated
rock</a>,
the New Almaden site is now <a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/parks/parkfinder/pages/almadenpark.aspx">Almaden Quicksilver County
Park</a>.
In the area&#39;s Guadalupe and Almaden reservoirs, fishing is strictly
catch and release due to mercury levels that remain high. &quot;I can readily
pan tiny beads of mercury for miles downstream,&quot; said now retired
Michael Cox, who worked as an environmental remediation consultant with
New Almaden Quicksilver County Park Association. </p>
<p>The New Almaden mercury mining lives on in other ways. The <em>San Jose
Mercury News</em> newspaper owes its moniker to the importance of mercury in
the local economy (and also partly to Mercury, the Roman god of commerce
whose winged feet made him extra fast). Place names in the area also
reflect this history---Cinnabar Elementary School, for example.</p>

Quicksilver Mines, 12 miles from downtown San Jose. Here, workers heated
the red cinnabar ore to extract quicksilver---mercury in its elemental
form---for use in placer mining for gold. To this day, the waste from
this largest mercury mining operation in North America, mostly shut down
by 1905, contaminates local streams, reservoirs, and the San Francisco
Bay. Credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:New_Alm_smelter.jpg">Carlton
