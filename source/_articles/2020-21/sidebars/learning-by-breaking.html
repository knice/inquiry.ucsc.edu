<h3>Learning by breaking</h3>

<p>It&#39;s one of the oldest tactics in the genetics research playbook: to
understand a biological process, knock out the genes that control it
(usually in fruit flies or mice) and watch what goes wrong. In the past,
scientists did this in scattershot fashion using DNA-damaging chemicals.
These days they use more exacting tools like <a href="https://www.umassmed.edu/rti/biology/how-rnai-works/">RNA
interference</a> and
<a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/questions-and-answers-about-crispr">CRISPR</a>
to selectively block the expression of specific genes.</p>
<p>Bill Sullivan isn&#39;t just a seasoned practitioner of the craft; he&#39;s
written a famous description of it, a parable called <a href="https://sullivan.mcdb.ucsc.edu/assays/Sullivan_Doug.pdf"><em>The Salvation of
Doug</em>.</a> It
tells the story of a geneticist (a stand-in for Sullivan) and a
biochemist (the titular Doug, based on Sullivan&#39;s friend <a href="https://mcd.ucsc.edu/faculty/kellogg.html"><strong>Doug
Kellogg</strong></a>, professor of
molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz) applying
the tools of their respective trades to figure out how cars work. The
biochemist grinds up cars and analyzes their chemical composition,
learning a lot about their makeup but nothing of their function. The
geneticist takes the knockout approach, hogtying autoworkers on their
way to the car factory and noting the defects in vehicles rolling off
the assembly line. For example, tying up one worker results in cars that
lack steering wheels and swerve uncontrollably. By a process of
subtraction, the geneticist is able to suss out how cars are built and
what their parts do.</p>
<p>Originally published in a genetics newsletter in 1993, the story took on
a life of its own---downloaded thousands of times, assigned in college
classes, and translated into multiple languages. You&#39;d think any author
would be jazzed to see their prose go viral, but Sullivan is over it.
&quot;I&#39;d rather be known for my research,&quot; he said, &quot;but I&#39;m still
introduced at speaking engagements as the guy who wrote <em>The Salvation
of Doug</em>.&quot;</p>
