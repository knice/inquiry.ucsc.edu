<h3>Words to fuel action</h3>

<p>From the wide porch of his Victorian house on a hill in Washington,
Frederick Douglass, you might say, could see his past, present, and
future: in the distance was Maryland, where he grew up enslaved;
surrounding him was his stately home and grounds; and close by across
the river stood the country&#39;s capital, with its numerous political
engagements and appointments. What Douglass couldn&#39;t see was how
far-reaching his legacy, especially his words, would be.</p>
<p>In classrooms and auditoriums across the country, debate leagues and
<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2017-05-24/urban-high-school-debate-programs-highlight-a-better-way-to-learn">[thousands of
students</a>
cultivate the ancient art of using words and their power to arouse and
agitate for change, just as Douglass did in his early teens when he
embraced <a href="https://archive.org/details/columbianoratorc00bing/page/8"><em>[The Columbian
Orator</em></a>
as a guide for his self-education. Other young activists draw from their
personal experiences and passions, like Douglass, to make their cases
for change.</p>
<p>Here is a sampling of what these emerging leaders have to say:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://blackfeministcollective.com/2019/03/24/the-movement-against-gun-violence-needs-look-like-everyone/">[Mei-Ling
Ho-Shing</a>,
19, survivor, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting: &quot;At the
end of the day, a black boy from Chicago and a white girl from
Parkland need to be able to sit at a decision-making table and
bounce back ideas on how to end this nationwide crisis in our
country. Gun violence is capable of affecting everyone, so the
movement needs to look like everyone.&quot;</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.earthguardians.org/xiuhtezcatl">[Xiuhtezcatl
Martinez</a>,
20, youth director for Earth Guardians: &quot;In the light of a
collapsing world---what better time to be born than now? Because
this generation gets to rewrite history, gets to leave our mark on
this Earth, we will be known as &#39;The Generation,&#39; as the people on
the planet that brought forth a healthy, just, sustainable world for
every generation to come.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/cnn-town-hall-applauds-jacob-9-year-old-transgender-american">[Jacob
Lemay</a>,
9, LGBTQ rights activist: \&quot;My name is Jacob, and I\&#39;m a 9-year-old
transgender American. My question is: what will you do in your first
week as president to make sure that kids like me feel safer in
schools? And what do you think schools need to do better to make
sure that I don\&#39;t have to worry about anything but my homework?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/49812183">[Greta
Thunberg</a>,
17, climate activist: \&quot;I want you to act as if the house is on
fire, because it is.\&quot;</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/12/malala-yousafzai-united-nations-education-speech-text">[Malala
Yousafzai</a>,
22, education advocate for girls: &quot;So, let us wage a glorious
struggle against illiteracy, poverty and terrorism, let us pick up
our books and our pens, they are the most powerful weapons. One
child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world.&quot;</p>
