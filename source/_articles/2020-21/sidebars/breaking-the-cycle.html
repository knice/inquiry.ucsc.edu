<p>Started in 1997, Egypt&#39;s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293883/">[National Schistosomiasis Control
Program</a>
offered the medication
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praziquantel">praziquantel</a> to all school
children in the Nile Delta. By 2010, the infection rate had dropped from
more than 30 percent in many rural villages to less than 3.5 percent.
But schistosomiasis remains a public health concern, both in Egypt and
elsewhere, with an estimated 140 million people infected worldwide. &quot;It
is true that incidence of infection has decreased,&quot; said Sanaa Antonios,
professor of parasitology at Tanta University in Egypt. &quot;However, in
some spots in the country it is still present, which is alarming.&quot;
Infections are especially common in children, who swim in the canals in
the summer and don&#39;t know the danger of schistosomiasis, she said. Women
are also at increased risk, as they are now much more likely to work in
and around the water with men.</p>
<p>And changing waterways are still a problem in Africa. In neighboring
Ethiopia, a transformation in agriculture is underway, with new efforts
to cultivate the lowland areas of the country to grow sugar, cotton, and
other cash crops, said parasitologist <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bayissa_Chala2">[Bayissa
Chala</a>
at the Adama Science and Technology University in Ethiopia. &quot;Resurgence
or even outbreak of urogenital schistosomiasis in endemic areas where
the snail hosts thrive is possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In 2012, the World Health Organization launched <a href="https://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/NTD_RoadMap_2012_Fullversion.pdf">[an effort to eliminate
schistosomiasis as a public health issue by
2025</a>,
primarily by targeting school-age children and other at-risk groups for
preventive treatment with praziquantel. But a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6785807/">[recent status
update</a>
indicates that many countries have failed to meet interim goals.
&quot;Although praziquantel is effective, it does not prevent re-infection,&quot;
said <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/laura.braun13">[Laura
Braun</a>, an
engineer and researcher at Imperial College London. &quot;Anyone going back
in the lake or river is likely to get infected again.&quot; A multi-pronged
approach that also includes water treatment and educational campaigns
might be more effective than simply providing praziquantel, Braun said,
&quot;because it prevents people from getting infected in the first place.&quot;</p>

as schistosomiasis. Two main species infect humans in sub-Saharan
Africa: <em>S. haematobium,</em> which affects the urinary tract and <em>S.
mansoni,</em> which affects the liver. The parasite&#39;s life cycle begins in
freshwater snails, which release free-swimming &quot;cercariae&quot; that bore
through human skin. Once inside a human host, the parasites grow into
mature worms that pump out eggs. The eggs work their way through the
tissues, over time resulting in chronic, progressive damage to the
bladder or liver. Infected people pass along the eggs by urinating or
defecating into water, where the eggs hatch into &quot;miracidia&quot; that infect
the snails, starting the cycle anew. Credit: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/schistosomiasis/modules/Schistomes_LifeCycle_lg.jpg">[Centers for Disease
