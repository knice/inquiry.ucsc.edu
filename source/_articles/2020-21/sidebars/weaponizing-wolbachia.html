<h3>Weaponizing <em>Wolbachia</em></h3>
<p>The viral diseases <a href="https://www.outbreakobservatory.org/outbreakthursday-1/3/21/2019/the-global-rise-of-dengue-infections">dengue
fever</a>,
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html">zika</a>, and
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/geo/index.html">chikungunya</a> have been
spreading at alarming rates in recent years&mdash;in part, it&#39;s thought,
because <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007213">global warming is extending the
range</a>
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti"><em>Aedes aegypti</em>
mosquitoes</a> that transmit
the viruses to humans. Now medical researchers are fighting back with a
new weapon: <em>Wolbachia</em>.</p>
<p>For reasons still unclear, mosquitoes infected with <em>Wolbachia</em> make
lousy hosts for RNA viruses such as dengue, zika, and chikungunya, and
hence don&#39;t pass them to humans. <em>Wolbachia</em> naturally infects many
mosquito species, but not <em>A, aegypti.</em> Organizations such as the <a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/">World
Mosquito Program</a> are working to
change that. They&#39;re raising <em>Wolbachia</em>-infected female <em>A. aegypti</em>
and releasing them into the wild. The infected females breed with wild
males and, assisted by cytoplasmic incompatibility (see figure below),
spread <em>Wolbachia</em> throughout the local <em>A. aegypti</em> population.
Remarkably, it seems to be working. In pilot studies in Southeast Asia
and Australia, the program has seen <a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/news-stories/media-releases/wolbachia-mosquitoes-block-dengue-across-australias-far-north">dramatic drops in dengue
transmission</a>.</p>

million infected mosquito larvae. When released, the infected adult
males mate with wild, uninfected females, rendering them infertile.

<p>While that approach aims to tamp down the viruses in mosquitoes, another
method exploits the flipside of cytoplasmic incompatibility to suppress
the mosquitoes themselves. Public health organizations around the world
are raising and releasing <em>Wolbachia</em>-infected <em>A. aegypti</em> males, which
act like flying contraceptives, mating with wild uninfected females and
ensuring that their eggs don&#39;t hatch. Bill Sullivan witnessed this
strategy in action on a 2018 visit to the Sun Yat-sen
University--Michigan State University <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2019/successful-suppression-of-mosquitoes-using-sterile-males-in-china/">Joint Center of Vector Control
for Tropical
Diseases</a>
in Guangzhou, China. &quot;It was incredible,&quot; he said. &quot;They were breeding
and releasing 10 million infected males a week,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;d load
them into little drone airplanes, which zipped around, spitting out a
million mosquitoes at a time.&quot;</p>

Whereas <em>Wolbachia</em>-infected females can breed with any male&mdash;infected or not&mdash;uninfected females can only produce viable offspring with uninfected males.
