Along Northern California's coastline, scientists have found concerning
levels of mercury in two top predators. In the Santa Cruz Mountains,
[**Peter Weiss-Penzias**](https://research.pbsci.ucsc.edu/metx/pweiss/),
a UC Santa Cruz associate researcher in microbiology and environmental
toxicology, discovered that coastal-dwelling pumas have [three times the
amount of the toxic heavy
metal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54056-7) in their fur
and whiskers compared to inland mountain lions. And in UCSC dining
halls, ecotoxicologist [**Myra
Finkelstein**](https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/directory_lecturers.php?uid=myraf),
an adjunct associate professor, documented that some students were
eating [more than 20 servings of tuna a
week](https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/etc.4513)---enough
to accumulate potentially harmful levels of mercury in their bodies.

Both cases are worrisome. Mercury is a neurotoxin, and high enough doses
degrade the mental capacities and motor skills of those exposed. In
pregnant mothers, the metal can enter the womb and harm infant brains.
And the silvery element can build up in the living tissues of both
plants and animals, compounding the danger.

Despite relatively recent laws and treaties that now limit its release,
a lot of mercury has wound up in bodies of water&mdash;creeks, rivers,
lakes, and the ocean&mdash;where it transforms into its most toxic form and
enters food chains. In addition, key steps in the metal's movements
through the environment&mdash;its "biogeochemistry"---remain unclear,
including how it changes from its less dangerous, inert forms to an
organic molecule that accumulates in living tissue. To better understand
the mercury threat, UCSC scientists are working to learn how this
mysterious element shifts between its different forms. "Nothing is
simple when it comes to mercury," said Weiss-Penzias. "It has a way of
disappearing and then reappearing somewhere else."

## Gold and coal ##

The elevated levels of mercury in the environment today are the result
of its current and historic use in gold mining, and from the continued
use of coal for energy production. Gold Rush--era mining contaminated
watersheds throughout California. Miners used the shiny liquid
quicksilver&mdash;mercury in its pure, elemental form&mdash;to recover gold from
gravel deposits adjacent to rivers. At these [placer
mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placer_mining), miners washed
gold-containing sediments through sluices lined with quicksilver. The
mercury and gold formed a heavy amalgam easily sifted from other
sediments. In the process, much of the metal escaped and drained into
rivers and streams. An estimated [10 million pounds of
mercury](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3014/) entered the environment
from placer mining throughout California. The San Francisco Bay is
tainted by this past, as are the [131
reservoirs](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/mercury/reservoirs/)
identified by the state as "mercury-impaired."

Today, small-scale gold mining in Asia, Africa, and South America still
relies on mercury&mdash;and may account for [over half of ongoing global
mercury
pollution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5969110/#__ffn_sectitle).
The remainder comes primarily from coal-powered energy production.
Millions of years ago, the metal glommed onto the ancient plant and
animal remains that eventually became coal. Now, burning this fossil
fuel releases mercury into the atmosphere as a gas that drifts around
the globe.

Thanks to gold mining and coal burning, a lot of mercury contaminates
the environment. "The general consensus is that we've increased the
amount of mercury moving around the active reservoirs of the Earth&mdash;the
ocean, soils, and the atmosphere&mdash;by somewhere between a factor of
three and seven," said associate professor of ocean sciences [**Carl
Lamborg**](https://oceansci.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=clamborg), an
expert in the biogeochemistry of mercury. "Seventy-five percent or more
of all the mercury in the air around you right now is a consequence of
human activity."

## Mobilized metal ##

All this mobilized mercury exists in three main forms. Its elemental
form, Hg0, the liquid quicksilver at room temperature, easily
volatilizes into a gas. That gaseous mercury becomes charged in the
atmosphere to its Hg2+ form, or mercuric ions. These ions can diffuse
into water. Under low-oxygen conditions, such as in lake bottom,
coastal, and seafloor sediments, bacteria convert mercuric ions into
[methylmercury](https://www.epa.gov/mercury/how-people-are-exposed-mercury)
(CH3Hg+ ions. Toxicologists worry especially about methylmercury.
"The mercury in our bodies is mostly methylmercury," said Lamborg.
"Methylmercury by itself is not necessarily more toxic than any other
form of mercury, but it sits there as a reservoir that bleeds out into
the rest of your tissues."

That methylmercury comes mostly from eating fish, especially top
predator fish. In the ocean, methylmercury sticks to phytoplankton,
which are eaten by small fish, which are eaten by tuna, swordfish, and
sharks. At every step up the food chain, the metal becomes more
concentrated. Each tiny plankton accumulates mercury across its life,
and fish eat these concentrated morsels. Plankton eaters have about 100
times more mercury in their bodies than what's in their food. And top
predators&mdash;like the tuna served at UCSC dining halls&mdash;have mercury
concentrations another 100 times higher than plankton eaters. When we
eat tuna, more than 90 percent of the methylmercury in the fish remains
in our bodies, stored mostly in fat. From there, some slowly releases as
mercuric ions, which is what does the damage to our tissues. To play it
safe, Finkelstein recommends minimizing your exposure by being careful
about what type and how much fish you eat (see table below).

But fish is apparently not the only way mercury gets into the bodies of
land animals. In 2010, while working in the Elkhorn Slough, an estuary
on the coast about halfway between Santa Cruz and Monterey,
Weiss-Penzias wondered about the thick fog that rolled in every day.
When he analyzed fog droplets for mercury, the concentration was much
higher than he expected. In [research that
followed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54056-7),
Weiss-Penzias showed how this mercury entered the food chain: lichen and
plants absorbed the fog, deer eat the lichen and plants, and mountain
lions eat the deer. One coastal mountain lion he sampled (via its fur
and whiskers) had levels of mercury [known to be toxic to mink and
otters](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/eisler/CHR_10_Mercury.pdf), and two
others showed concentrations that could cause confusion and potentially
impair their ability to breed and parent kittens.

## Toxic pathways ##

While the mercury in tuna, humans, and pumas ultimately traces back to
the methylmercury generated in the ocean by anaerobic bacteria, exactly
how these microbes transform elemental mercury into methylmercury
remains unknown. It's not a result of their metabolism&mdash;these anaerobes
eat organic matter and breathe sulfate or oxidized iron. Another process
must drive the change.

And although these microbes typically live in low-oxygen environments,
mercury methylation has been shown to occur even in well-aerated ocean
waters that contain few methylating bacteria. This suggests there's
probably another pathway to methylmercury in addition to the one
associated with the anaerobes. According to [Feiyue
Wang](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wangf/), professor of biogeochemistry
at the University of Manitoba in Canada, there's a "bizarre" shallow
layer of methylmercury in the Arctic Ocean, even though those waters are
well-oxygenated. "In that kind of water, we normally would not
anticipate a large population of anaerobic bacteria," Wang said. "This
newly discovered phenomenon really forces us to consider other
possibilities."

To investigate the mercury methylation process, Lamborg has directed
research to selectively filter seawater to narrow down the possibilities
by a process of elimination. In an experiment performed by graduate
student [Kathleen
Munson](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kathleen_Munson), now a
postdoctoral fellow at the University of Manitoba, methylmercury
continued to form in seawater samples after all the microbes were
filtered out. Lamborg has some leads on the mystery reaction. Bacteria
produce vitamin B12, and that could react with mercuric ions to
produce methylmercury. "There\'s all this circumstantial evidence
suggesting that we should be looking for a B12-related mechanism," he
said.

Another enigma lies at the bottom of the San Francisco Bay, where the
sediments contain an estimated [five-fold
increase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703710006393?via%3Dihub#b0075)
in mercury from natural levels due to gold production activity,
including from mercury mining (see sidebar). However, the fish reeled in
contain low levels of mercury. One explanation is that most of the
mercury remains in the inert form in which it was mined, mercury sulfide
(known as [cinnabar](https://geology.com/minerals/cinnabar.shtml), with
its characteristic red color). "It should make us all nervous," said
Lamborg. "If we messed with that system in some way, that could make
that mercury suddenly bioavailable to methylating bacteria."

ocean sciences and mercury biogeochemistry expert Carl Lamborg, to

## Living with it ##

A better understanding of mercury's elusive movements could help to
minimize its toxic effects. It could, for instance, suggest ways for
clean-up efforts at contaminated sites to keep the sedimentary mercury
in its inert cinnabar form. But even with targeted clean-up efforts at
some reservoirs and wetlands, we can't do anything about most of the
mercury we've already unleashed. "You can't clean up the ocean, you
can't clean up the atmosphere," said Weiss-Penzias. "It's just too
dispersed."

Meanwhile, Weiss-Penzias continues to study how mercury makes its way
into the mouths of humans and other animals. After he published his
study on the element in pumas, he received many concerned inquiries,
including from a farmer who worried about their goats eating lichen.
Weiss-Penzias hopes [an experiment he's
planning](https://experiment.com/projects/mercury-is-in-our-fog-so-what-about-our-food)
can help address some of the concerns, by measuring how mercury-laden
fog might be affecting strawberries, broccoli, and artichokes grown on
the Central Coast.

More education about mercury exposure is probably also a good idea. In
her dining hall study, Finkelstein found that nearly all the students
were unaware of the risk associated with eating too much tuna. "Many
students seem to have limited to no understanding," she said. "It was
alarming." Finkelstein said that while a national educational effort has
aimed to keep women from eating mercury-rich fish during pregnancy, the
risk to the general public&mdash;including to children and young adults,
whose developing brains may also be vulnerable&mdash;isn't widely
acknowledged. "It has changed what I allow my children to eat,"
Finkelstein said. "I think about it a lot. We are exposed to such a
large amount of chemicals on a daily basis."

This risk&mdash;and the element's enigmatic ways&mdash;keep the UCSC mercury
scientists engaged. "I've been working in the field for almost 20 years
trying to understand the fate and transport of mercury in the
environment," said Weiss-Penzias. "It's still quite vexing."
