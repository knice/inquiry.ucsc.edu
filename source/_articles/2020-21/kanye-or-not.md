Imagine a tabletop game where cards illustrated with faces stand in
racks before you and your opponent. You're ready to take turns asking
yes-or-no questions to guess each other's unseen cards. Wait...what's
this? All the faces depict black men, and half are [Kanye
West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West).

This is *['ye or
nay?](https://prettydarke.cool/portfolio/ye-or-nay/)*, a
game/artwork created by assistant professor of digital arts and new
media and critical race and ethnic studies **[A. M.
Darke](https://prettydarke.cool/bio/)**, a conceptual
artist and activist who designs tools for social intervention. A work in
progress with illustrator [Tajae
Keith](https://tajaekeithillustration.carrd.co/), *'ye or
nay?* is Darke's satirical reimagining of *[Guess
Who?](https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Moves-Games-1191-Guess/dp/B00S732WJE/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Guess+who+game&qid=1582492126&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-2)*,
the classic game in which the first question commonly asks: male? (or
female?). Darke replaces this question in *'ye or nay?* with one based
on a "far less ridiculous binary": Kanye West? (or not Kanye West?).

By requiring players to describe and differentiate among black men,
*'ye or nay?* provides opportunities for them to reflect on their
perceptions and biases in an engaging way, Darke said. But the main goal
of depicting black faces is so black people can see themselves
represented in a broader way than in mainstream, white-dominated
culture, they said. "*'ye or nay?* is just as much about celebrating
black male beauty as it is about examining the language we build around
blackness."
