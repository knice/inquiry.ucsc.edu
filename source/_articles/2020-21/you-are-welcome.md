Associate professor of psychology [**Rebecca
Covarrubias**](https://psychology.ucsc.edu/about/people/faculty.php?uid=rgcovarr)
spent nine long years in Tucson studying at the University of Arizona.
While she often visited home, her family visited the university to drop
her off for her freshman year, and once again when she graduated with
her doctorate. The university was so unfamiliar to them as to be "almost
unwelcoming," she said. "Home was only a two-hour drive away, but it
felt like worlds apart."

It was initially unfamiliar and hard for Covarrubias, too. She now aims
to make this cultural mashup---a challenge for many "first-gen" college
students like herself---more visible and less stressful.

While universities value independence and intellectual exploration,
first-gen college students from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds are
often balancing---and are strengthened by---family obligations. They
care for siblings, translate at medical appointments, or offer financial
support. "A university culture of independence and separation largely
renders these connections invisible," said Covarrubias, whose
[research](https://rcovarrubias.sites.ucsc.edu/) focuses on issues of
identity, culture, health, and educational quality/access for
underrepresented and diverse individuals.

To help bridge the divide, Covarrubias works with the [Hispanic-Serving
Institutions initiative's Sense of Belonging
team](https://hsi.ucsc.edu/get-involved/index.html) to organize a free,
bilingual, [half-day conference for low-income, first-gen
families](https://hsi.ucsc.edu/building-equity/MAPA%20Grant%20Programs/mapa-regional-conference.html)
to meet parents of graduated students with similar backgrounds.
Institutions must also change, said Covarrubias, who serves as faculty
director of the [Student Success Equity Research
Center](https://sserc.ucsc.edu/). "We can give students tools to
navigate academia, but we also need to create a culture that reflects
students' varied backgrounds and ways of being."
