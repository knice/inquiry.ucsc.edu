[White-nose syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-nose_syndrome)
has killed millions of bats, cutting a deadly path across North America.
Originally confined to the eastern United States, the disease is now
affecting bats in Washington, Oregon, and California.

Caused by the fungus *Pseudogymnoascus destructans*, the disease attacks
bats when they are hibernating, said Professor [**Marm
Kilpatrick**](http://kilpatrick.eeb.ucsc.edu/). The disease appears as a
white powder on the bats' skin, hence its name.

Kilpatrick, a disease ecologist, was interested in how the fungus spread
between and among different bat species never observed in social groups
or in contact with each other. To study this, Kilpatrick and [**Joseph
Hoyt**](https://hoytresearch.org/), then a doctoral student (and now an
assistant professor at Virginia Tech), daubed a UV fluorescent powder,
which mimics the fungus, on individual bats. Tracking the dust's spread
in the caves and to other bats
[showed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0720-z) how
"cryptic" connections---shared contact with part of the cave or very
brief contact with other bats---play a key role in transmission of the
fungal pathogen. The mechanism is similar to how contact between
strangers coming together in planes or subway cars, or in stores or
cafes, might spread human pathogens, like the coronavirus in the
[Covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019)
pandemic, Kilpatrick said.

The overall prognosis for bat species in North America is dire, said
Kilpatrick, who is also researching [potential
treatments](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45453-z). The
[northern long-eared
bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotis_septentrionalis), for example,
has suffered population declines of more than 99 percent; three other
species have also been heavily affected but will likely persist. "The
disease has caused massive, enormous declines," Kilpatrick said.
