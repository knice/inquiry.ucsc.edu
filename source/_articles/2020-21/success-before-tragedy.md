To create the [Peoples
Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Temple) in 1955, its
founders merged religious ideology with a vision of a world that
transcended race and social class. Twenty-four years later, more than
900 of the group's members lay dead, their bodies decomposing in the
Guyanese jungle heat.

The group's written records both reflect and&mdash;importantly&mdash;shaped its
tragic path, said teaching professor of writing [**Heather
Shearer**](https://writing.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=hshearer).
Shearer began researching the group's documents expecting to find
evidence of "brainwashed cult members," she said. "But I saw a really
different picture."

Ninety-six boxes of letters, pledges, and checklists&mdash;some on memo pads
printed with the header "Verbal orders don't go&mdash;write it!"---bear
witness to the group's meticulous planning and utopian achievements: a
racially integrated church in 1950s Indiana, communal housing developed
in Northern California, and members' excitement as they built
[Jonestown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown). "They're known for
dying, but let's not forget what they accomplished," Shearer said. "It's
impressive how organized they were, and how the writing helped them
organize."

Dismissing them as a cult denies what we learn from their written
communications, Shearer said. "They had noble aspirations. The documents
show how much they wanted to build a better society and how hard they
worked for it."
