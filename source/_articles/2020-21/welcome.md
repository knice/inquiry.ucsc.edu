Welcome to the 6<sup>th</sup> edition of *inquiry\@UC Santa Cruz*, our annual
showcase of the exceptional research being performed at UC Santa Cruz
across its five academic divisions.

As in previous years, the stories in these pages were crafted by alumni
of the world-renowned UC Santa Cruz [Science Communication Master\'s
Program](https://scicom.ucsc.edu/) (see
[INQUIRING**minds**](https://inquiry.ucsc.edu/2019-20/contributors/)).
Their writing this year invites you to: view an artist's work that asks
us to contemplate history from a modern perspective; mind your manners
when interacting with robots; plunge into the politics of multi-city
coalitions and their fight against climate change; open your mind to how
the expansion of gender identities is changing the world; embrace the
uncertainty of a mathematical quest; dive into aquaculture and a mission
to provide a more sustainable approach for satisfying the world's
growing appetite for farm-raised fish; track mercury\'s hazardous
journey through our habitats, including the college cafeteria; travel
the Nile via a historical exploration of how its changing course has
impacted human health; and, in our cover story, admire a ubiquitous
bacterium whose wily ways are unexpectedly providing valuable insights
into the complexities of cell biology and solutions to age-old scourges.
In addition, in [PEN**&**INQ](https://inquiry.ucsc.edu/2019-20/books/)
you'll find selected books authored by our faculty; likewise, you'll
find recent inventions highlighted in
[**inquiries&**INNOVATIONS](https://inquiry.ucsc.edu/2019-20/innovations/).

Importantly, this year we celebrate our new chancellor---professor of
chemistry Cynthia Larive, a highly accomplished researcher and
educator---as well as our new membership in the Association of American
Universities (AAU), a prestigious and influential group composed of
America's 65 leading research universities (see [BRIEF
**inquiries**](https://inquiry.ucsc.edu/2019-20/briefs/)). The
outstanding breadth, depth, and creativity of the UC Santa Cruz research
enterprise provides a wealth of intellectual adventures to share with
you. We hope you enjoy this sampling!
