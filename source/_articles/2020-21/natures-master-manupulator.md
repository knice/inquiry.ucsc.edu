Calling a lowly microbe intelligent may seem over the top, but you can
forgive a little hyperbole when [**Bill
Sullivan**](https://mcd.ucsc.edu/faculty/sullivan.html) describes the
bacterium [*Wolbachia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolbachia) as
"really smart." Sullivan, UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of
molecular, cell, and developmental biology, is explaining how the
intracellular parasite sneaks its way through the embryos of certain
fruit flies and into their nascent eggs, allowing it to pass from one
generation of flies to the next. *Wolbachia* appears to do this by
hitching rides on the fly's motor proteins, which carry supplies to the
egg-producing region of the embryo. The proteins march along a system of
microtubules, like porters lugging cargo up the gangways of ships.

Partway through the proceedings, the embryo does a 180, flipping the
polarity of the microtubules. Motor proteins that had been trooping
toward the egg-zone do an about-face and start heading away. Getting to
the mothership now requires hopping aboard a different type of motor
protein, designed to seek the "plus" end of the microtubule instead of
the "minus" end. And---here's the really smart part---that's exactly
what *Wolbachia* does, deftly rejiggering binding sites on its surface
to make the switch. If, as Sullivan suspects, the embryo's microtubular
reversal is meant to deflect invading parasites, *Wolbachia* does an
end-around and keeps on coming.

## The great pandemic ##

</figure>That maneuver, discovered by Sullivan and colleagues, is just one of
many exploits that have made *Wolbachia* one of the most successful
parasites on Earth. It's believed to infect roughly half the world's
several million insect species. Stick a butterfly or beetle, wasp or
fly, ant or bedbug under a sufficiently powerful microscope, and there's
a decent chance you'll find *Wolbachia* in some of its cells, tucked
into the cytoplasm like tapioca pearls in pudding. *Wolbachia* shacks up
in other invertebrates, too, including mites, ticks, spiders, and some
nematode worms. Its sheer ubiquity has led some scientists to dub the
contagion ["one of the great pandemics in the history of
Life."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775348/)

*Wolbachia* doesn't directly infect humans, but it has a way of getting
into the heads of biologists captivated by its machinations, its global
conquests, and increasingly, its potential as a weapon against some of
humanity's greatest scourges. "It's an amazing organism," said [**Laura
Serbus**](https://case.fiu.edu/about/directory/profiles/serbus-laura.html),
a former postdoc of Sullivan's who now studies *Wolbachia* in her own
lab as assistant professor of biological sciences at Florida
International University. "It's teaching us so much about how infections
and cells themselves work."

Sullivan's own relationship with *Wolbachia* started casually enough. He
was teaching an undergraduate genetics course and looking to liven
things up with field trips. When he read that a bacterium, *Wolbachia*,
was sweeping northward through California's fruit fly population, he
hatched a plan: he and his students would hit up local wineries and
apple orchards, collect the swarming flies and analyze them to see if
the infection had reached Santa Cruz County (it had).

That was 20 years ago, and what began as a fling has become a lasting
passion. Today, Sullivan is recognized as a leading expert on
*Wolbachia*, at a time when worldwide interest in the bacterium is
exploding. "The field has gotten so much more crowded and competitive
than it used to be," said population biologist [Michael
Turelli](https://cpb.ucdavis.edu/people/michael-turelli), distinguished
professor of genetics at UC Davis, who's been researching *Wolbachia*
since the late 1990s. "But at the big international meetings, people
still look to Bill when it comes to the cell biology of *Wolbachia*."

## Microscopic moviemaking ##
{% include_relative sidebars/learning-by-breaking.html classes="right" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" %}
In retrospect it was a natural fit. Sullivan was schooled in the
genetics of *Drosophila melanogaster*, the classic laboratory fruit fly
(online he's been known to use the screen name "Count Drosophila"). And
he was adept at methods used to probe the innermost workings of cells.
As a postdoc in the 1980s, he'd cut his teeth in live fluorescent
microscopy, tagging proteins with dyes that light up under the
microscope, then watching, and filming, cellular events as they played
out in real time. Sullivan refers to it as "making movies," and his lab
has produced thousands of [short
films](https://sullivan.mcdb.ucsc.edu/images-movies.html) over the years
(example titles: *Syncytial Divisions*, and the sequel, *Syncytial
Divisions II*).

The first *Wolbachia*-related problem he applied those skills to is
something called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), one of the ploys
*Wolbachia* uses to spread among insects. *Wolbachia* is transmitted
hereditarily via insects' eggs, so the more *Wolbachia*-infected females
there are, the more the bacteria propagate. *Wolbachia* helps things
along by turning infected males into a form of selective birth control.
When these males mate with uninfected females, the pairing is sterile.
Infected females, on the other hand, can reproduce successfully with any
male, infected or not. With this big advantage in the mating game,
*Wolbachia*-carrying females outbreed their competition and can quickly
take over populations.
<figure class="" style="width:600px;">

inside the cells of its hosts. Here, *Wolbachia* (large ovals) crowd the

and Environmental Sciences, Sorbonne University, with permission.</figcaption>
</figure>
But exactly how CI scuppers the infected male/uninfected female crosses
wasn't known. Using their moviemaking chops, Sullivan and then-postdoc
[**Uyen Tram**](https://molgen.osu.edu/people/tram.1) (now a research
associate at the Ohio State University), traced the problem to a timing
glitch at the very beginning of embryogenesis, just after the egg is
fertilized by sperm and starts dividing. When things are working
properly, paternal chromosomes from the sperm and maternal chromosomes
from the egg are in lockstep as they replicate and line up together in
the middle of the cell. At that point the egg begins cleaving,
ultimately creating two new cells with identical sets of mom and pop
chromosomes. But in the case of CI, the father's chromosomes are late to
the party. They're slow to replicate and fail to line up in time for
cleavage. This leaves the daughter cells with only half the chromosomes
they need. The embryo is DOA.

</figure>

Sullivan and Tram submitted their findings to the journal [*Science* in
2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12004132). The paper was
quickly greenlighted without further revision---a rare feat in the
persnickety world of top-tier science publications. After that
auspicious beginning, Sullivan and team went on to work out a more
detailed model that's a leading theory of how CI works. It explains not
only why normal females can't breed with infected males, but why
infected females can: *Wolbachia* seems to delay the maternal
chromosomes to match the late-arriving paternal ones, ensuring that all
pieces are in place before division occurs.

## Evolutionary ingenuity ##

That was the first of many Wolbachian mysteries explored by Sullivan and
his collaborators. In 2004, along with postdocs Laura Serbus and
[**Shelbi
Russell**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelbi-russell-30baba16) and
then-Ph.D. student **[Patrick
Ferree](https://www.kecksci.claremont.edu/faculty/profile.asp?FacultyID=231)**
(now an associate professor of biology at Claremont McKenna College), he
began tackling another puzzle: how *Wolbachia* gets into the germ line,
the cells that give rise to eggs and sperm. It's a trek the microbes
have to make in each new generation of insects they infect. They start
out scattered throughout the egg cell inherited from the infected
mother, but soon after fertilization, the bacteria begin migrating to
the posterior end of the egg, the part that will become the germ tissue
of the embryonic fly.

Using the tools of knockout genetics (see sidebar) on *Drosophila
melanogaster*, Sullivan and team were able to piece together the
[molecular
mechanics](https://sullivan.mcdb.ucsc.edu/pdf/Serbus_2007.pdf) described
in the opening paragraphs above: how *Wolbachia* infiltrates cellular
supply lines, latches onto motor proteins, and changes horses in
mid-stream to get to the rear of the egg.

It's a bravura display of evolutionary ingenuity, and not least because
*Wolbachia* strikes such a delicate balance. While it binds to some of
the available motor proteins, it also leaves plenty of slots open for
the embryo's own supplies. "[As Shelbi Russell has
shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110520/),
*Wolbachia* seems to have evolved as a weak competitor for the
attachment sites, so it doesn't impair the embryo's development,"
Sullivan said. Playing nice with hosts is good parasite policy. If they
thrive, so does *Wolbachia*.

Sullivan and his team weren't just uncovering the secrets of
*Wolbachia*; they were developing new tools and techniques for
*Wolbachia* research. Since *Wolbachia* can't live outside of cells,
studying it had previously meant working with whole infected insects:
breeding them, subjecting them to various treatments, dissecting out the
tissues of interest, and eyeballing the samples under the microscope to
see the effects on *Wolbachia*. It was laborious and complicated. With
the help of the cell biologist [Alain
Debec](https://www.ijm.fr/en/185/research-groups/team.htm) of the
[Institute of Ecology and Environmental
Sciences](https://ieesparis.ufr918.upmc.fr/?lang=en) at the Sorbonne
University in Paris, Sullivan's group radically simplified matters by
developing the first *Wolbachia*-infected *Drosophila* [cell
line](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cell-line):
cells containing *Wolbachia* that could be raised in vitro. "You can
grow them indefinitely, freeze them, thaw them out whenever you need
them, and do all sorts of neat things," Sullivan said.

One of the neat things Sullivan did was to apply new "high throughput"
lab technology---implemented by UC Santa Cruz professor of chemistry
[**Scott
Lokey**](https://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/about/directory-page.php?uid=slokey)---to
streamline testing and assays. Instead of wrangling flies, manually
manipulating them and inspecting specimens one by one, he and his team
could process hundreds of cell samples in batches using robotic handling
systems. Mechanized microscopes could scan the samples and analyze the
results. This automated approach made procedures like knockout genetics
hundreds of times faster. "We could accomplish in weeks what would have
taken years," Sullivan said.

## The worm turns ##

In the mid-2000s, Sullivan's research took another turn when he learned
that *Wolbachia* had been implicated in two major human maladies:
[onchocerciasis](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/onchocerciasis/gen_info/faqs.html)
and [lymphatic
filariasis](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/lymphaticfilariasis/gen_info/faqs.html),
better known, respectively, as river blindness and elephantiasis. The
two diseases, which afflict more than 150 million people in tropical
regions, are caused by parasitic filarial nematodes transmitted by
blood-feeding insects. Once in humans, the threadlike adult worms pump
out larvae that circulate through the body and can get stuck in tissues,
causing grievous damage: permanent vision loss in river blindness and
horrific swelling of the limbs and genitals in elephantiasis.

Now researchers were reporting that *Wolbachia* living in the worms was
at least partly to blame. The bacteria, leaking from the nematodes,
seemed to trigger a hyper-immune reaction and severe inflammation
responsible for some of the worst symptoms. What's more, the worms
depended on *Wolbachia* for their very survival. In filarial nematodes,
*Wolbachia* is an "[obligate mutualistic
endosymbiont](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/mutualism),"
a symbiotic sidekick the worms can't live without.

The corollary was clear: kill the germ, and you could kill the worm.
This was a potential game-changer. No drug existed that could safely rid
sufferers of the adult nematodes. Instead, the standard treatment
consists of killing the larvae with "microfilaricide" medications. Since
the adult worms continue to churn out new larvae and can live in humans
for a decade or more, keeping symptoms in check means patients have to
take microfilaricides for years. But what if you could kill the adult
worms after all, by dispatching the *Wolbachia* inside them using
anti-bacterial meds? Then a real cure might finally be at hand.

Initial tests were encouraging. One study found that a six-week course
of the antibiotic doxycycline could sharply reduce filarial nematodes in
elephantiasis patients. That was a major step forward, but still not the
magic bullet researchers were hoping for. Doxycycline isn't safe for
children and pregnant women, and six weeks of drug therapy isn't
practical for the kind of mass administration programs needed to reach
millions of people in underdeveloped areas. The hunt was on for new
compounds that offered speedier, simpler treatment. The effort got a big
boost from the [Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/), which was pouring
hundreds of millions of dollars into the fight against river blindness,
elephantiasis, and other [neglected tropical
diseases](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/what-we-do/global-health/neglected-tropical-diseases)
that affect the world's poorest people.

Sullivan was no expert on tropical medicine, or nematode worms for that
matter (he is a fly guy), but he knew a lot about *Wolbachia* and
thought he might have something to contribute. Attending a conference on
tropical diseases in 2007, he met scientists from the [Anti-Wolbachia
Consortium (A•WOL)](https://awol.lstmed.ac.uk/), which had begun drug
discovery with Gates Foundation backing. "The problem was that they were
using older, slower assay methods," said Sullivan. "I told them we had a
better way." As luck would have it, the cell line and high-throughput
automated assay system used by Sullivan's team were tailor-made for
testing potential anti-*Wolbachia* drugs.

Two months later, with support from A•WOL and funding by the Gates
Foundation, Sullivan had his own drug-screening operation up and running
on Lokey's high-throughput equipment. Over the next few years, Sullivan
and his team checked almost 5,000 substances, looking for compounds that
could kill *Wolbachia* without harming the host *Drosophila* cells. They
found one,
[albendazole](https://sullivan.mcdb.ucsc.edu/pdf/Serbus_2012.pdf), that
showed promise. Subsequent studies by A•WOL-affiliated researchers
demonstrated that in combination with doxycycline, albendazole was able
to shorten treatment times from six weeks to one. Larger clinical trials
are underway.

After that initial success, it was time to scale up. The Lokey lab was
at capacity, so Sullivan reached out to [the California Institute for
Biomedical
Research](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/calibr/)
([Calibr](https://calibr.org/)), a nonprofit that develops
next-generation medicines, and set them up with the cell line and assay
system. Together, Calibr and Sullivan's lab have now identified several
promising drug candidates while screening more than 300,000 compounds.

## The dark side of symbiosis ##
{% include_relative sidebars/weaponizing-wolbachia.html classes="left" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" %} 
While Calibr and other organizations continue to search for new drugs,
Sullivan has gone back to more fundamental questions. The nature of the
worm-germ symbiosis, for example: it's obvious what *Wolbachia* gets out
of the deal---room and board---but what does it bring to the table? To
answer the question, Sullivan and postdoc [**Frederic
Landmann**](http://www.crbm.cnrs.fr/en/team/mechanisms-of-symbiosis-with-wolbachia/)
(now an assistant professor at the [Montpellier Cell Biology Research
Center](http://www.crbm.cnrs.fr/en/) in southern France) treated
filarial nematodes with antibiotics, wiping out the *Wolbachia* inside
them. With the bacteria purged, development of young worms was
scrambled, the embryos fatally deformed. In adult worms,
[apoptosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis)---a type of
programmed cell death that organisms use to cull unwanted cells---went
wild, leading to the mass suicide of normal cells.
<figure class="" style="width:600px;">
  {% asset 2020/nematode.png @magick:resize=600 alt:'Walbachia in nematode oocyte' %}<figcaption>A nematode oocyte (egg-producing structure) shows *Wolbachia* (green
specks) in the developing eggs. Credit: Frederic Landmann, with
permission.</figcaption>
</figure>
No wonder the worms need *Wolbachia* to live; it seems to play a role in
regulating several essential processes. But for Sullivan, that left a
nagging question. Why do the nematodes rely on a bacterium to do things
that other species, including the worms' own evolutionary forebearers,
could handle quite well on their own? Sullivan believes that something
less benign is at work than the win-win partnership implied by
"mutualistic symbiosis." Instead of providing a service to nematodes in
need, *Wolbachia* may have muscled its way into machinery that was
already working just fine, shoving aside existing components and making
itself indispensable for its own selfish ends.

Sullivan calls this "addictive symbiosis" (a phrase he borrowed from the
book [*The Symbiotic
Habit*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691113425/the-symbiotic-habit),
by entomologist [Angela E.
Douglas](https://entomology.cals.cornell.edu/people/angela-e-douglas/)),
and he thinks it may be far more common in nature than assumed by
conventional biological thinking, with its "comforting mutualistic
kumbaya view." [He
writes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5576898/), "I would
argue that many obligate endosymbiotic relationships are more akin to a
big-box store locating in a town: much outcry and displacement, but
ultimately a dependence on its presence. Simply by its presence, the box
store created a need where none previously existed. Both in society and
in biology, addictive symbiosis may be the rule rather than the
exception."

Linington, with permission.</figcaption>
</figure>
Whether it's a cozy alliance or hostile takeover, worm and germ may be
headed for a full-blown merger. Sullivan and others speculate that
*Wolbachia* might someday become an intrinsic feature of its nematode
hosts, like the ancient bacteria that long ago invaded our single-celled
ancestors and became mitochondria---the intracellular "power houses"
that all higher life forms depend on.

That example points out just how fluid and negotiable roles like
[parasite, pathogen, and
mutualist](https://study.com/academy/lesson/symbiotic-relationships-mutualism-commensalism-amensalism.html)
can be. *Wolbachia* blurs the bright lines between those categories, and
between organisms themselves. It tends to fuzz the boundaries between
scientific domains, too. **"**The work that Bill's done has given us new
insight into how Wolbachia does its thing, and in the long run my bet is
that it's going to help us understand how symbionts in general do their
thing," said [Barton
Slatko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barton-slatko-42960612), a molecular
parasitologist at [New England Biolabs](https://www.neb.com/) who
studies *Wolbachia* in nematodes. "It goes beyond cell biology and has
implications for population biology, ecology, and evolution."

Exploring those implications is the goal of Sullivan's next big
*Wolbachia* venture, a collaboration with population biologists Michael
Turelli at UC Davis and [Brandon
Cooper](http://www.cooper-lab.org/people.html), an assistant professor
of biological sciences at the University of Montana. Their goal is what
Turelli calls a "grand synthesis" connecting Wolbachia's microscopic
meddling to its large-scale effects on species and ecosystems.

For Sullivan it's just one more twist in a mostly accidental journey. "I
was fascinated by what *Wolbachia* does to cells and had no idea our
work would have biomedical and ecological relevance," he said. "It's
really a story of where curiosity can take you." Curiosity, and,
Sullivan admits, maybe a little something else: "It could be a case of
addictive symbiosis."
