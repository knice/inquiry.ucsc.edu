[Okinawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Island), a tiny speck in
the vast Pacific Ocean, plays an outsized role in American history. For
75 years, since the end of World War II, the United States has occupied
this smallest of the five main islands of Japan with a string of
strategically significant military bases.

The consequences of this occupation are the focus of the [Okinawa
Memories Initiative](https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/the-gail-project/), a
sprawling oral history project led by associate professor of history
[**Alan
Christy**](https://history.ucsc.edu/news-events/profiles/alan-christy.html).
The work aims to document and understand the dramatic social changes
that occurred as Okinawan society rapidly transformed from very
traditional to very modern.

their elders on Okinawa, which rapidly modernized following the island&#39;s
1945 occupation by the U.S. military that continues to this day. This

favorite of <strong>Geri Gail</strong>, a former UCSC staff member who <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/09/gail-project-exhibition.html">donated the
collection</a>
of her father&#39;s snapshots of Okinawa in the early 1950s to UCSC in 2013.

The research chronicles, for example, the impact of a surge in high-tech
entertainment and media services. Based on this business focus,
[Naha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naha), the island's main city, is
poised to become a major driver of the Japanese economy over the next
decades, Christy said. "The media environment is incredible for a place
its size," he said.

The project, which began with the donation of a cache of [photographs
taken by Charles Eugene
Gail](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8t43w8t/), an American
military officer stationed on Okinawa in the early 1950s, has since
broadened its scope to encompass the entire occupation, from 1945 to the
present. To uncover the personal stories of Okinawans during this time
of major transformation, Christy and collaborators use interviews,
photographs, and archival records found in both Okinawa and Washington,
DC. "The changes that happened here are historically significant, and
well worth understanding," Christy said.
