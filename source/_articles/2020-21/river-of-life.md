Every August, the flood came. The river spilled and filled into the
basins Egyptian farmers had carved out to hold the water that made crops
thrive. When the floodwaters receded in October, farmers planted the
winter crops of wheat and barley. Spring was for harvesting. By summer,
the river sank to its lowest levels. Smaller plots of sugarcane, cotton,
fruits, and vegetables grew on riverbanks. And when the flood came
again, it cleansed the soil for the next season while nurturing flood
crops like maize, rice, and sorghum, staple foods for local farming
communities.

The lives of the people along the Nile, too, swayed to this seasonal
rhythm. Villagers tended to the flow of the river when it rose; they
planted crops when it fell. They feasted after the spring harvest, then
suffered through the windy, dry summer. These people and their river
made Egypt one of the richest lands in the world. As a province of the
Ottoman Empire, Egypt supplied wheat to the Ottoman capital of
Constantinople, and to Muslim pilgrims on their way to Mecca. (The
Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capitol was moved to Ankara,
and Constantinople was renamed Istanbul in 1903.)

But by the turn of the 20th century, life along the Nile danced to a
different and more demanding beat. In the 1820s, increased interest in
cash crops like cotton drove construction of deep irrigation canals to
extend the growing season. Then came the first big dam. Built by British
engineers and more than 10,000 laborers about 1,000 kilometers upstream
from Cairo, the [[Khazan Aswan (or Aswan Low)
Dam]{.underline}](https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/370649) was completed in
1902, four years after construction started in 1898. The resulting
changes in the Nile shifted farming along the river from the ebb and
flow of flood, winter, spring, and summer to a year-round calendar of
crops. And in addition to transforming the river, the now ever-present
water turned the bodies of Egyptians, particularly the men who worked
the land, into new colonies of constant, debilitating disease.

The research of UC Santa Cruz associate professor of history
[**[Jennifer
Derr]{.underline}**](https://history.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/index.php?uid=jderr)
focuses on this period of transformation, tying together colonial
politics, the altered Nile, and the changing health of the people who
had for centuries flourished on the river's flood plain. In her recently
published (July 2019) book, [*[The Lived Nile: Environment, Disease, and
Material Colonial Economy in
Egypt]{.underline}*](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29529), Derr
writes about how changes in the Nile triggered new plagues that
afflicted many Egyptians until the late 20th century. In her book and
continuing research, Derr searches for connections between people and
the world around them. "Human health does not exist separate and apart
from environmental health," she said, whether along the Nile River more
than a century ago or elsewhere in the world today. "This is one of the
primary lenses through which I try to understand the effects of climate
change and our experiences of the planet."

## The backstory ##

Derr found her research focus while traveling a winding academic path.
As an undergraduate at Stanford University, she studied biology and
worked as an oncology researcher, thinking she would go into medicine.
Then she traveled to Egypt on a study abroad program and began learning
Arabic. Derr loved studying the language, and "what it meant to live in
a place and work to understand it deeply." After completing a master's
degree in Arab studies at Georgetown University, she circled back to
Stanford for her doctorate in history. Here, she dove into the history
of the modern Middle East, writing her dissertation on agriculture,
irrigation, and colonial politics in the southern part of Egypt in the
late 1800s and early 1900s. Modern history drew her attention because it
aligns with how she attempts to understand the world: "When I encounter
something, I always want to know the backstory. History is central to
how I understand politics and the dynamics of our contemporary world."
{% include_relative sidebars/dam-drawbacks.html classes="left" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" %}
One of the major backstories Derr explores in her book concerns
[[schistosomiasis]{.underline}](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis),
a disease caused by parasitic flatworms with a complex life cycle
involving two hosts, humans and freshwater snails. Two species of the
parasite, *Schistosoma haematobium* and *S. mansoni*, cause the disease
in Egypt. More debilitating than deadly, schistosomiasis nonetheless
remains a substantial problem in the developing world. Massive public
health campaigns against schistosomiasis, also called bilharzia, have
been undertaken in Egypt, including a [[recent \$10 million eradication
effort supported by the World Health
Organization]{.underline}](https://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/news/Egypt_leverages_domestic_funding_to_eliminate_schistosomiasis/en/).

The changes in the Nile substantially exacerbated the impact of
schistosomiasis. Studies in the Nile Delta and Valley in the 1930s found
that about 60 percent of people in areas with year-round irrigation were
infected with one or both species of *Schistosoma*. In contrast, the
average infection rate was only 5 percent in areas of southern Egypt
where people still followed traditional basin agriculture practices. The
disease wasn't new---*Schistosoma* eggs, thousands of years old, have
been found preserved in mummies. But the rates of infection, where they
occurred, and the symptoms that people suffered were transformed
beginning in the 19th century. The changing geography and prevalence of
infection, "strongly links it to the spread of perennial irrigation,"
Derr said.

Derr, who came to UCSC in 2012, spent years sifting through government
archives and records held by research institutions to learn about the
history of the Nile River, its changing political, economic, and
environmental landscapes, and the lives of the people who worked in and
around its waters. "Jennifer\'s work sheds light on the historical
intersections of disease, water management, and social policy in modern
Egypt," said assistant professor of history [**[Alma
Heckman]{.underline}**](https://history.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/index.php?uid=aheckman),
who studies modern Jewish history in North Africa and the Middle East.

In records found in the [[Egyptian National Library and
Archives]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_National_Library_and_Archives)
in Cairo, state archives in the United Kingdom and France, and a variety
of smaller collections including those of the [[Institution of Civil
Engineers]{.underline}](https://www.ice.org.uk/) in London and the
[Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/), Derr
traced the changing Nile, starting in the early 1800s, when Egyptian
viceroy Mehmed Ali began to corral more water to grow cotton to sell on
the world markets. The British occupation of Egypt in 1882 brought more
ambitious ideas of large-scale engineering and profits that shaped and
rapidly changed Egypt in the decades to come.

## Greater contact ##

Even before the first large dam tamed the Nile, the new focus on summer
irrigation put Egyptian laborers into greater contact with the water,
standing knee-deep as they operated the manual irrigation tools that
lifted water to their crops. More time in the water meant more exposure
to the *Schistosoma* cercariae---the infectious form of the parasite.
Workers with higher worm loads in their systems suffered more painful
manifestations of disease. In addition to the tell-tale bloody urine
and, ultimately for many, bladder cancer, those most severely afflicted
might develop debilitating large growths in sensitive areas of their
bodies. The constant irrigation promoted other diseases as well,
including
[[hookworm]{.underline}](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/hookworm/index.html),
associated with moist soil, and
[[pellagra]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pellagra),
a nutritional deficiency linked to changing food staples. By connecting
the altered Nile to the emergence of disease, Derr's work shows "just
how deeply and viscerally humans are connected to their environment,"
said [[Alan
Mikhail]{.underline}](https://history.yale.edu/people/alan-mikhail),
professor and chair of the Department of History at Yale University.
"What is in the water of the Nile courses through the human body," said
Mikhail, an expert on Egypt during the time of the Ottoman Empire.

Today, we know that rivers large and small carry contaminants and
bacteria through their channels and surrounding environments. We also
know the channels of the human body through which water-borne toxins and
pathogens can flow to cause disease. But these channels were yet to be
discovered at the time the Nile began taking its modern shape. "People
didn't understand disease through the model of infection and contagion,"
Derr said. In Egypt and elsewhere, people believed disease resulted from
"[[imbalances in
humors]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism)" within the
body wrought, in part, by outside influences, such as the season or the
alignment of planets. Illness was also associated with native peoples
and the places they lived, with schistosomiasis known as a disease of
warm weather.

As the Nile changed and schistosomiasis became more widespread, the
views and attention of scientists also shifted. European scientists
studied the disease during the colonial period, but their interest waned
with the fading of that era, and schistosomiasis became just one of many
"[[neglected tropical
diseases]{.underline}](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/ntd/diseases/index.html)."
One facet of Derr's research endeavors to uncover the work of Egyptian
scientists who continued to study the disease. In the 1920s, Egyptian
physician Muhammad Khalil led the Bilharzia Research Section of the
Egyptian Public Health Department. Khalil and colleagues mapped
infections with the two species of schistosomes to geographic areas
within Egypt, set up treatment programs for schistosomiasis and other
diseases, and conducted public health campaigns to prevent infection. As
Egypt's battle with the disease persisted, Egyptian physicians and
scientists stood at the forefront of research and treatment, Derr said.

## A larger narrative ##

Schistosomiasis also provides a backstory for a larger narrative Derr
plans to tell about the history of Egypt through the bodies of its
people. As the Nile continued to change in the 20th century, the disease did too. Infections with *S. mansoni*, the species that can damage the
liver, were previously seen in limited areas on the Nile. But with the
construction of the [[Aswan High
Dam]{.underline}](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aswan-High-Dam),
completed in 1970, "newly created upstream water reservoirs, as well as
altered river currents and sedimentation, markedly affected the relative
distribution of snails carrying different Schistosoma species," said
[[Sanaa
Antonios]{.underline}](http://tdb2.tanta.edu.eg/staff/StaffDetails_en.aspx?staff_id=2640),
a professor of parasitology at Tanta University in Egypt. And where the
snails go, so goes the disease, with a resulting boom in *S. mansoni*
infections.

</figure>
Thanks in large part to this surge in *S. mansoni* infections, liver
disease emerged as a major health problem in Egypt in the second half of
the 20th century. Untreated, *S. mansoni* infections can lead to liver
cancer. In addition, from the 1920s until the 1980s, health-care workers
often treated schistosomiasis with multiple injections of [[tartar
emetic]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_potassium_tartrate),
unintentionally introducing another assault on the liver. Extensive
needle reuse and poor sterilization associated with these
injections---and treatment of other conditions---led to the spread of
the hepatitis C virus and the insidious liver disease it causes. Until
its [very recent mass treatment
campaign](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1915818), Egypt
reported the highest prevalence of [[hepatitis
C]{.underline}](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm) of any
country in the world.

Derr's next book will chronicle the history of liver disease in
20th-century Egypt. Her research finds her scouring archives across the
world, interviewing physicians, and attending scientific meetings on
liver disease. In addition to investigating the connections between the
environment and liver disease, she plans to explore how Egyptian
scientists---often relegated to second-class status in global medical
circles---have contributed to the field of tropical medicine.

Looking at history through an environmental lens allows Derr to see the
interaction of large and small, how country-wide decisions about water
management can impact microscopic parasites. These interactions continue
to play out on the Nile today. Although upstream users control the water
on most rivers, Egypt has been the exception. "Egypt is the furthest
downstream, and, yet, throughout the course of history, it has been in
charge of how the Nile's resources have been used," said Mikhail. But
now Ethiopia, Egypt's southern neighbor, will soon complete the [[Grand
Ethiopian Renaissance
Dam]{.underline}](https://www.salini-impregilo.com/en/projects/dams-hydroelectric-plants/grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-project)
on the Blue Nile, allowing it to contain the Nile at its upper reaches.
As of late March 2020, tense---and sometimes aborted---discussions over
the new dam continued between the two countries. To lessen the potential
impact on the Nile downstream, Egypt has asked for a slow fill of the
new dam's huge reservoir.

Derr's research suggests that, even as these political discussions play
out, the new dam's impact could be both more subtle and more widespread
across Egypt and neighboring countries than expected, potentially
affecting anything and everything connected to the Nile. "Derr\'s work
is very timely for how we understand public health and the environment
in contemporary Egypt, and provides insights that apply across North
Africa," said assistant professor of history [**Muriam Haleh
Davis**](https://humanities.ucsc.edu/academics/faculty/index.php?uid=muhdavis),
who studies development, decolonization, and race in North Africa. The
connections between these North African nations and their neighbors have
recently become part of Derr's academic remit, as she directs the newly
launched (early 2020) UCSC [[Center for the Middle East and North
Africa]{.underline}](https://thi.ucsc.edu/centers/middle-east-and-north-africa/).

Looking outward from North Africa, Derr said, "the question of how we
treat the environment is fundamentally also a question of what will
happen to our own bodies." As our seasons become warmer and wilder, we
may find ourselves altered as well, the channels of our personal
watersheds harboring new threats from emerging viruses and other menaces
not yet imagined. Where else will our changing rivers take us?
