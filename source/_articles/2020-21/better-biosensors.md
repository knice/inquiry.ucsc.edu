Efforts to improve sensors that can measure biological substances in or
on the body&mdash;for monitoring glucose in diabetics, for example&mdash;face
the challenge of working at the pH (hydrogen ion) levels found in living
organisms. Human blood, sweat, and tears typically have a pH of around
'7'. "Unfortunately, many metals that are good at measuring substances
like glucose are only effective at pH 11," said professor of electrical
engineering [**Marco
Rolandi**](https://rolandi.soe.ucsc.edu/index.html).

Rolandi and his team have now overcome the pH challenge. Their research
leading to the patent-pending invention was published in July 2019 in
the *Nature* journal [*Scientific
Reports*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46302-9). By
boosting the immediately surrounding pH, their millimeter-sized,
metal-based biosensor can measure glucose levels in a solution that
mimics body fluids.

those found in the human body. Here, Rolandi points to an enlarged image

The group created the biosensor by depositing small amounts of different
metals on glass using a process called
[photolithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography).
Palladium metal increases the nearby pH by drawing hydrogen ions out of
solution. The higher pH levels allow cobalt-oxide contacts next to the
palladium to react with glucose and change oxidation state; the device
measures the resulting current to determine the glucose concentration.

The metal-based biosensor could offer advantages over current glucose
monitors for diabetics, which typically last only months as the enzymes
on which they rely eventually degrade. In addition, such a device
implanted in the body may be less tissue-reactive, Rolandi said.
