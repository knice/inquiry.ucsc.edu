A prevalent theory posits that simple organic molecules initiated a
primitive version of metabolism in [hydrothermal
vents](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro1991) deep in the ocean,
leading four billion years ago to the origin of life. Professor of
biomolecular engineering [**David
Deamer**](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=dwdeamer)
thinks otherwise.

\"There are layers of difficulty trying to get reactions to work in
underwater vents,\" Deamer said. As explained in his book [*Assembling
Life*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/assembling-life-9780190646387/)
(January 2019), Deamer's alternative theory suggests that these critical
molecular transformations occurred under more favorable conditions: in
hot springs associated with volcanoes.

Small pools fed by hot springs would have contained mixtures of
[nucleotides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid)---the building
blocks of DNA and RNA---mixed with
[lipids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid), the primary component of
cell membranes. When the pools evaporated, concentrated films of
nucleotides and lipids would form on mineral surfaces. Under these
conditions the nucleotides spontaneously link into DNA and RNA, a
reaction demonstrated in Deamer's lab, which, incidentally, led to a
[patent](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10280191). Ongoing wet-dry
cycles selected for chemically stable, lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid
chains, creating the molecular seeds for the emergence of living
organisms.

Deamer and research associate [**Bruce
Damer**](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/bdamer) tested the idea by
adding nucleotides to water samples from natural hot springs in volcanic
sites around the world. Analysis of the mixtures cycled through wet-dry
phases [revealed microscopic
vesicles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29748464) containing
polymers. Although not alive, these "protocells" are an essential first
step toward molecular systems that can initiate Darwinian evolution,
Deamer said.
