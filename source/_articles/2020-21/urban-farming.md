Even in a city, a wildlife haven might be just around the corner. In
[urban gardens](https://www.urbangardenecology.com/gardens.html)
throughout Santa Cruz, the Monterey Bay Area, and Santa Clara County,
[**Stacy
Philpott**](https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=sphilpot),
professor and director of the [Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food
Systems](https://casfs.ucsc.edu/), has cataloged a wealth of species, at
least 60 types of bees, 25 of spiders, 18 of ladybugs, and about 60 of
birds.

Philpott and her [research group](https://www.urbangardenecology.com/)
study how differences in urban gardens, like their "messiness" and the
number and types of nearby trees and shrubs, affect their
[biodiversity](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/biodiversity/).
In general, the group finds that what's good for biodiversity is good
for human gardeners too. Their experiments suggest that gardens with
more biodiversity have more effective pollination and [natural pest
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_pest_control).

appealing. But its ecological complexity with a large variety of weeds
and flowers provides important food resources that can support a greater
biodiversity of insects. </figcaption>

while wood chip mulching might look nice, it can discourage nesting by
bumblebees and visits by other pollinators. But it could attract other
beneficial arthropods, like spiders. Credit: Stacy Philpott, with

It's also clear that urban gardens can be invaluable to the people who
use them. Surveys of community members who work these gardens show that
many garden as a way to spend time outdoors, relieve stress, and hang
out with their families. For some, having access to a space to grow
produce provides a vital way to put food on the table. A substantial
number of lower-income gardeners surveyed experience some [food
insecurity](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/definitions-of-food-security.aspx),
Philpott said. "There\'s a lot of demand for space in cities and many
interests competing for its use," Philpott said. "Our research shows
that gardens are important spaces."
