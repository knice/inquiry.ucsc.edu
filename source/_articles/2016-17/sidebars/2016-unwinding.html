<p>Above: Colon cancer cells express PASD1, the protein that can block the clock. By using a bioluminescent tag, researchers could illuminate the weak, glowing circadian waves (RED) of the cancer-afflicted cells. When they restricted PASD1 expression, the clock dramatically improved (BLUE), resuming its more regular sine wave form.</p>
