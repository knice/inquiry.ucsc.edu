<h3>Hitchcock and HABS</h3>

{% asset 2016/p13-shearwater.png @magick:resize=200 alt:"Landsat 8 image of Lake Erie" class:right %}

<p>Alfred Hitchcock's film classic, The Birds, was based on a short story by English writer Daphne du Maurier.</p>

<p>But Hitchcock was also inspired by a 1961 news story about flocks of suddenly berserk birds that slaughtered themselves by dive-bombing buildings in Capitola, a town on Monterey Bay near his vacation home.</p>

<p>Raphael Kudela studied zooplankton cells preserved after that event and found they contained Pseudo-nitzschia, a marine algae that can make domoic acid. And the behavior of the disoriented birds, he noted, is consistent with the toxin's neurologic effects.</p>
